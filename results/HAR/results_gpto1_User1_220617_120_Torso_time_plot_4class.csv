They are neither too small (which would suggest being still) nor excessively large (which would suggest running). 2) Looking at the gyroscope data: there is a noticeable regular fluctuation around ±0.2–0.3, consistent with torso rotation during walking steps. This oscillation is not as high-amplitude or high-frequency as one would expect in running. 3) Comparing to being in a car: car movements typically produce more sporadic changes tied to acceleration/deceleration and turns, but the strong, regular gyroscope oscillations seen here are more indicative of a human gait. 4) Conclusion: the combination of moderate, periodic accelerations and gyroscope patterns strongly indicates that the person is walking.",False

Second, the gyroscope, while not completely still, exhibits only modest random fluctuations—consistent with small rotations or vibrations (e.g.
road/vehicle motion) rather than the stronger, cyclical angular velocities we see when a torso moves with each step.
