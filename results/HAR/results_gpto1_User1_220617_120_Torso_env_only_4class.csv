35,1498121563330,1498121573320,Still,Walking,"1) The camera’s vantage point suggests it is carried at approximately chest height at street level, likely on a person rather than in a vehicle. 2) There is no visible car interior (e.g., dashboard or window edges), making it unlikely that the photo was taken from inside a car. 3) There are no strong indicators of high-speed motion (e.g., significant blur) that might suggest running. 4) Consequently, being on foot, at a moderate pace, is the most plausible explanation, consistent with ‘Walking’ rather than ‘Still’ or ‘Run’ or ‘Car.’"
36,1498121573330,1498121583320,Still,Still,"From the camera's perspective—held at torso level—there is no evident motion blur or shift indicative of walking or running. Furthermore, no vehicle interior (e.g. windshield, windows, dashboard) is visible to suggest being in a car. The scene looks stable, with the horizon level and the viewer apparently standing near the curb, indicating the person is not in motion and is most likely stationary."
37,1498121583330,1498121593320,Still,Walking,"From the camera’s vantage point, it appears the wearer is at roughly standing height on a sidewalk, looking out across a street at parked and passing cars. There is no indication of sitting inside a vehicle (e.g., windshield or interior) nor of noticeable motion blur one might expect from running. Consequently, the most likely transportation method is that the person is on foot (walking)."
38,1498121593330,1498121603320,Still,Still,"1) The camera view appears level and stable with no noticeable motion blur. 2) The perspective is from the side of the road, rather than inside a vehicle or in active movement. 3) There is no evident sway or tilt that would typically be associated with walking or running. 4) Therefore, the most likely interpretation is that the person is standing still."
39,1498121603330,1498121613320,Still,Still,"From this single photo, there is no indication of movement: there is no visible motion blur, no vehicle interior, and the viewpoint appears at street level near a sidewalk bollard. If the camera were in a moving car, we would typically see the vehicle’s interior or windshield. If the user were walking or running, we might expect more obvious signs of motion (e.g., blur or a shifted framing). Since none of these are present, the most likely conclusion is that the person was standing still when this photo was taken."
40,1498121613330,1498121623320,Still,Still,"From the vantage point in the photo, the camera appears to be positioned at standing height on the sidewalk, with no evident signs of motion (e.g., no motion blur or trailing of objects). The photographer’s viewpoint is not inside a vehicle (no windshield, dashboard, or interior visible), and there are no indicators of running or walking (such as blurriness or a lower, forward-leaning perspective). Given these observations, the most likely transportation method at the time this image was captured is that the person was standing still."
41,1498121623330,1498121633320,Still,Still,"1) The image is taken from a position on or near the sidewalk, with a clear external view of the street and no visible vehicle interior. 2) There is no obvious motion blur or viewpoint shift indicating movement (as might be expected with walking or running). 3) There are no visual cues that the camera is inside a car, such as dashboards or windows. 4) Consequently, the most likely scenario is that the person holding the camera is stationary (Still)."
42,1498121633330,1498121643320,Still,Still,"From the camera’s vantage point—roughly chest‐height on a sidewalk with a clear view of the street—there is no evident motion blur or indication of forward movement that would suggest walking or running. The absence of a car’s interior (e.g., no windshield or dashboard) also argues against being in a car. Thus, the scene most strongly indicates that the person is stationary (Still)."
43,1498121643330,1498121653320,Still,Still,"1) The camera viewpoint appears to be at standing height on a sidewalk, indicating the user is likely not inside a vehicle. 2) There is no visible motion blur or interior car framing, which would suggest being in a moving vehicle or running. 3) A single frame without evident forward motion or swinging perspective makes walking less certain. 4) Given these cues, the most plausible interpretation is that the user is standing still, observing the surroundings from the sidewalk."
44,1498121653330,1498121663320,Still,Still,"The camera view appears to be taken from a position on or adjacent to the sidewalk, and there is no visible indication of forward or rapid movement (no notable motion blur, no apparent stride or running gait). The horizon and surroundings look stable rather than in motion, suggesting that the person wearing the camera is not actively walking or running. There is also no evidence of being inside a vehicle (e.g., dashboard, interior). Consequently, 'Still' is the most likely transportation method."
45,1498121663330,1498121673320,Still,Still,"From the camera’s vantage point (roughly sidewalk-level, next to a post) and the lack of apparent motion blur or viewpoint shift, it appears the person is not in motion. The perspective suggests being on foot and stationary near a lamppost rather than inside a moving vehicle or actively walking/running. Hence, 'Still' is the most plausible category."
46,1498121673330,1498121683320,Still,Still,"From the viewpoint and lack of motion blur in the image, it appears the camera was stationary rather than moving. We do not see evidence of the camera being inside a vehicle (e.g., window reflections, dashboard) nor the shake associated with walking or running. Thus, the most likely mode of transportation in this scenario is that the person is standing still."
47,1498121683330,1498121693320,Still,Still,"1) The camera viewpoint is roughly at chest level on a sidewalk, with a clear, stable view of parked cars and a storefront. 2) There is no motion blur or indication of ongoing movement (e.g., no clear evidence of walking sway or running blur, and no sign of being inside a moving vehicle). 3) The perspective does not show typical elements of being in a car, like a windshield or dashboard. 4) Consequently, the most likely interpretation is that the person is stationary (Still)."
48,1498121693330,1498121703320,Still,Still,"In the provided image, there is no visible motion blur nor any indication of being inside a car (e.g., windshield, dashboard). The viewpoint appears to be from a relatively stable, ground-level position, suggesting the camera is not moving. Therefore, the person is most likely stationary (Still) rather than walking, running, or riding in a car."
49,1498121703330,1498121713320,Still,Still,"1) The photo shows a clear, stable view with no apparent motion blur or distortion. 2) The camera viewpoint appears roughly torso- or eye-level, and there are no visual cues indicating forward movement (e.g., no blurry foreground or tilted angle typical of running or walking footage). 3) The scene has the camera positioned on or near the sidewalk, and it does not seem to be inside a moving vehicle, nor does it show signs of being in motion. Based on these observations, the person’s most likely transportation method is being still (standing)."
50,1498121713330,1498121723320,Still,Still,"From a single still image, there are no signs of motion such as blur, tilt, or the visible interior of a vehicle. The camera perspective appears roughly at torso level on a sidewalk, with a stable horizon and no indication of the photographer’s own movement. Therefore, the most likely conclusion is that the person was not moving and is 'Still'."
51,1498121723330,1498121733320,Still,Still,"From the viewpoint and composition, the camera appears to be at roughly torso height and facing the street. The image shows no notable motion blur or other cues (such as glass reflections) that might suggest being inside a moving vehicle, nor do we see the characteristic blur of walking or running. The scene appears stationary, indicating that the person is standing still rather than walking, running, or riding in a car."
52,1498121733330,1498121743320,Still,Still,"1. The image appears stable with no visible motion blur or significant camera shake, which suggests the camera is not in motion. 2. The view is at roughly torso height on a sidewalk with no vehicle interior or windshield frame visible, making it unlikely the person is inside a car. 3. There is no indication of rapid movement (such as the blur you would see if the person were running), and no mid-step motion typical of walking. 4. These cues together most strongly indicate the person was standing still when this photo was taken."
53,1498121743330,1498121753320,Still,Walking,"From the camera’s height and free view of the street (no windshield, steering wheel, or cabin interior visible), it appears the person is on foot rather than inside a vehicle. The framing also lacks any obvious motion blur that might accompany running, and there is no sign of being stationary for a prolonged time. Hence, the most consistent explanation is that the person is walking."
54,1498121753330,1498121763320,Still,Still,"From the photo’s perspective (torso-level, outdoors, clear view of storefronts), there is no sign of motion blur or other indications of movement such as shaking or shifting vantage. The image does not appear to be taken through a car window or interior (no windshield, dashboard), which makes a car ride unlikely. Likewise, there’s no obvious motion-related blur that would suggest running or walking. Thus, the photographer seems to be stationary, indicating a ‘Still’ posture."
55,1498121763330,1498121818060,Still,Still,"1) The photo shows a stable, street-level viewpoint with no obvious motion blur or shifting perspective. 2) The camera’s view includes part of the person's torso in the lower part of the frame but shows no evidence of vertical bobbing or rapid lateral motion common in walking or running. 3) There is also no sign of being inside a vehicle (e.g., windshield or car interior). 4) Given these indicators—no apparent movement artifacts, no vehicle context—the most likely activity is that the person is stationary (Still)."
521,1498128463460,1498128473450,Still,Still,"From the photo, the environment appears to be indoors (likely a kitchen or similar setting), with a stable, non-blurred perspective. There is no visual evidence of motion (such as movement blur) that would indicate the person is walking or running, and the setting does not suggest being inside a vehicle. Therefore, the most likely action category is that the person is stationary (Still)."
522,1498128473460,1498128483450,Still,Still,"1. The photo appears to be taken indoors, presumably in a kitchen, showing a stable environment without noticeable motion blur or outside scenery.
2. The person’s arm is visible in the lower portion of the image, suggesting they may simply be standing or sitting in one place rather than walking or running.
3. There is no indication of being inside a moving vehicle (no car interior features or road views).
4. Based on these observations, the most likely activity is that the person is stationary, i.e., 'Still.'"
523,1498128483460,1498128493450,Still,Still,"From the image, it appears the camera is positioned in a stationary setting, likely indoors (the presence of kitchen cabinets, utensils, and a countertop suggest a home/kitchen environment). The surroundings do not show any motion blur or evidence of movement such as walking or running, nor is there any visible indication of a vehicle interior. Therefore, the most likely transportation method is that the person is stationary (still)."
524,1498128493460,1498128503450,Still,Still,"From the provided image, the scene appears to show a kitchen or indoor environment. There is a laptop on a countertop, along with other household items, and the person’s hand is visible holding a small item. There is no indication of outdoor movement or travel—no visual cues of a vehicle interior, no movement blur or street setting, and no signs of running or walking motion. The camera perspective suggests the individual is stationary, likely standing or seated indoors. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that the person is 'Still.'"
525,1498128503460,1498128513450,Still,Still,"From the camera angle and the visible environment (a kitchen countertop with a laptop, dishes, and a hand holding food), there is no indication of movement such as walking or running. The scene appears stationary, and there are no cues (like windows or a vehicle interior) that would suggest the person is in a car. Therefore, the most likely transportation method is that the individual is still (not moving)."
526,1498128513460,1498128523450,Still,Still,"In the photo, the camera captures an indoor kitchen setting with a laptop on a counter, various kitchen items, and someone’s hand holding food. There are no visual cues indicating movement or transportation—such as signs of forward motion, vibration, outdoor terrain, or vehicle interior. Instead, the environment and viewpoint suggest the person is stationary in a home or kitchen, which aligns best with the 'Still' category."
527,1498128523460,1498128533450,Still,Still,"From the image, it appears to be taken in a kitchen environment with a laptop on a countertop. There are no visible signs of motion such as blur or movement typical of walking or running. The setting also does not suggest the interior of a car. Therefore, the most likely category among the provided options is that the person is 'Still'."
528,1498128533460,1498128543450,Still,Still,"1. The photo shows a stationary kitchen setting, with no visible signs of movement (e.g., motion blur or a moving background). 2. A laptop is on the counter displaying a video, but there is no indication of travel or transportation. 3. The scene looks like a typical indoor home environment rather than one associated with being in a car or running/walking outdoors. 4. Thus, the most likely state is that the person is stationary (still) rather than walking, running, or riding in a car."
529,1498128543460,1498128553450,Still,Still,"From the image, we see a stationary kitchen environment with a laptop on a countertop, dishes nearby, and no visible signs of motion (such as blur or an outdoor/car context). There is no indication of movement or being in a vehicle. Consequently, the most plausible transportation method is that the person is not moving and is simply still."
1,1498121209100,1498121219090,Walking,Still,"1) The photo shows a stationary scene in front of a house, with no clear signs of motion such as blurring or an interior view of a car. 2) The camera placement in the torso region does not appear to be bouncing or in motion, which would be more evident if the person were walking or running. 3) There is no indication of movement at vehicular speed either, ruling out the car category. Given these observations, the most likely category is that the person is standing still."
2,1498121219100,1498121229090,Walking,Still,"1) There is no noticeable motion blur in the image (e.g., objects appear sharp, which usually indicates minimal camera movement). 2) The camera viewpoint is near torso height, suggesting the user is simply standing rather than seated in a vehicle or in motion. 3) No parts of a car interior, dashboard, or windows are visible, making car travel unlikely. 4) Nothing else in the environment suggests active movement (running or walking). From these observations, it appears the person is stationary ('Still')."
3,1498121229100,1498121239090,Walking,Still,"From a single image it is difficult to be certain, yet there is little evidence of movement or motion blur in the scene. The vantage point (roughly torso-level) shows a parked car and adjacent buildings without noticeable streaking or indications of forward movement that would suggest walking or running. Nor do we see an interior car view (e.g., windows, dashboard). Consequently, the most likely categorization is that the person is in a stationary (Still) position."
4,1498121239100,1498121249090,Walking,Still,"From the camera’s vantage point (torso height) and the lack of motion blur or noticeable camera movement, it appears the photographer is stationary. No indications (such as window reflections, interior vehicle elements, or strong motion blur) suggest they are inside a moving car or running. The scene looks calm and stable, suggesting the person is not walking or running, but rather standing still."
5,1498121249100,1498121259090,Walking,Still,"From the single image, there is no visible motion blur or indications of a bouncing perspective (common when running or walking), and no interior car features or evidence of travel at speed. The camera’s viewpoint appears stable and roughly at torso height with a clear, static view of parked cars and buildings. These clues suggest the person is standing still rather than walking, running, or riding in a car."
6,1498121259100,1498121269090,Walking,Still,"1) The image is extremely blurred and lacks any discernible features indicating motion or an external environment (e.g., scenery passing by, vehicle interior). 2) There is no apparent vibration, sway, or feature shift that might suggest walking, running, or riding in a car. 3) Given no visual clues of movement, the most reasonable conclusion is that the person is not in motion, hence 'Still.' However, the image quality provides inadequate information for a more confident classification."
7,1498121269100,1498121279090,Walking,Still,"The provided image is extremely blurred and lacks any clear indications of motion or recognizable environmental features. Since there is no visible motion blur, no discernible surroundings (such as a road, scenery passing by, or other hints that would suggest walking, running, or being inside a car), the most reasonable conclusion from the limited visual information is that the subject is not moving. Hence, 'Still' is the best estimate given the unclear photograph."
8,1498121279100,1498121289090,Walking,Still,"The image is extremely blurred and lacks any discernible features or motion cues (e.g., backgrounds whizzing by, distinct footstep patterns, or car interior elements). With no clear indication of movement from this single frame, the most reasonable assumption is that the subject is not actively traveling, hence 'Still' is the most fitting category."
9,1498121289100,1498121299090,Walking,Car,"From the photograph’s perspective, there is noticeable lateral motion blur on the nearby fence and bin, while more distant objects like the house appear relatively clearer. This pattern indicates that the camera is moving at a speed consistent with being in a vehicle rather than the slower pace (and associated vertical bobbing) of walking or running. The blur is both pronounced and primarily horizontal, which strongly suggests travel by car, as stillness or walking would show little to no motion blur, and running would generally introduce more erratic, bouncy motion patterns."
10,1498121299100,1498121309090,Walking,Car,"From looking at the photo, the surroundings (e.g. house walls, garden, trash bin) show a predominantly horizontal blur rather than the more erratic, bouncy motion blur typical of walking or running. The camera is quite stable at about torso height, and the foreground elements appear to pass by at a speed greater than a typical walk or run. These visual cues suggest that the person is in a vehicle moving at a steady velocity, which aligns with being in a car."
11,1498121309100,1498121319090,Walking,Car,"The scene appears slightly blurred, especially near the edges of the frame, suggesting that the camera (worn at torso level) is moving at a relatively higher speed than typical walking or running. The perspective is fairly stable and horizontally oriented, with little of the up-and-down motion commonly associated with running or walking. Such a smooth but relatively fast lateral motion blur usually indicates travel by car rather than on foot."
12,1498121319100,1498121329090,Walking,Walking,"The house and brick wall appear at close range, suggesting a pedestrian’s viewpoint on a sidewalk rather than being inside a vehicle. The slight blurring and partial arm in the frame are consistent with gentle motion—more than if the camera were completely still, but less jarring than a running action. Thus, the most likely transportation category is walking."
13,1498121329100,1498121339090,Walking,Walking,"From the single image, there is slight but noticeable blur and the camera is angled in a way that suggests moderate motion at a human walking pace. The background (a brick wall and house) is not streaked enough to suggest the higher speed of running or traveling in a car, and it does not appear entirely stationary either. The vantage point also aligns with a chest-mounted camera during walking, rather than the more pronounced and rapid motion blur one might expect from running or driving."
14,1498121339100,1498121349090,Walking,Walking,"From the camera perspective (roughly chest height) and the slight but not extreme motion blur/tilt, it appears the wearer is moving at a moderate pace on foot. A running shot would typically show more pronounced motion blur or a sharper tilt, and a car journey would likely display a higher speed context or a view from behind glass. The partial view of the arm in the foreground also suggests the person’s arms are swinging in a typical walking stride, leading to the conclusion that the person is walking."
15,1498121349100,1498121359090,Walking,Walking,"From the camera perspective (roughly at chest height) and the slight blur evident on nearby objects, it appears the wearer is moving at a moderate pace on foot rather than standing still, running, or being inside a vehicle. The image lacks the heavier blur or windowed view typically seen when traveling by car, and the level of motion blur is not so pronounced as to suggest running. Hence, walking is the most likely mode of transportation."
16,1498121359100,1498121369090,Walking,Car,"1. The angle and viewpoint indicate the photograph was taken from a position higher than ground level, consistent with chest- or torso-mounted viewpoint. 2. The background is noticeably blurred, suggesting relatively swift horizontal motion rather than the bobbing motion typical of walking or running. 3. The smoothness of the blur implies a stable ride, rather than the natural bounces and shakes that come from foot-based travel. 4. Given these visual cues, being in a car most plausibly explains the observed motion pattern."
17,1498121369100,1498121379090,Walking,Walking,"From the camera’s perspective, the image is captured at an approximately torso-level viewpoint in a suburban area. There is moderate motion blur but not to the degree typically associated with faster movement such as running or riding in a car. The slight tilt and blur are consistent with the regular sway of walking steps, and there are no visuals indicating a vehicle interior. Hence, walking is the most likely transportation method."
18,1498121379100,1498121389090,Walking,Still,"1) The viewpoint shows a stationary scene in a driveway with no visible interior of a vehicle, no signs of travel in a car, and no strong indicators of ongoing movement such as motion blur or camera shake. 2) The covered motorcycle in the driveway does not imply the person is driving it; it appears parked. 3) The camera angle is fairly stable, suggesting little to no motion on the wearer’s part. 4) Consequently, the most likely activity category here is 'Still.'"
19,1498121389100,1498121399090,Walking,Still,"1. The photo appears to have been taken from a torso-mounted camera; however, there is no obvious visual blur or motion that would suggest walking, running, or being inside a moving vehicle. 2. We see an arm or part of a body in the upper left corner and a relatively stable view of the house and the driveway, indicating minimal (if any) movement. 3. There is no interior car cabin visible, nor is the environment moving past the camera in a manner consistent with driving. 4. Therefore, the most likely category associated with this single-frame capture is that the person is stationary, i.e., 'Still.'"
20,1498121399100,1498121409090,Walking,Still,"1) The image shows a residential driveway with no distinct signs of motion blur or vehicle interior. 2) We see the photographer’s arm in the foreground, suggesting they are likely standing rather than driving or running. 3) There is no obvious movement or context (such as a car dashboard or motion streaks) that would imply transportation via car, walking, or running. Thus, the best match is that the person is still."
21,1498121409100,1498121419090,Walking,Still,"From this single, somewhat out-of-focus image, there is no clear indication of forward motion; we see neither obvious motion blur nor the typical views associated with being inside a vehicle (e.g., window, dashboard). Likewise, there is no pronounced blur that might suggest running. The environment shows a building and foliage without signs of rapid movement or a moving viewpoint. Consequently, the most likely explanation is that the person was not engaged in walking or running but rather standing still when the photo was taken."
22,1498121419100,1498121429090,Walking,Still,"1) The image does not show any interior features of a vehicle (e.g., steering wheel, dashboard) and thus does not point to being in a car. 2) There is no evident motion blur that would be expected if the person were running or walking at a brisk pace. 3) The foreground likely shows part of the person's torso or clothing, but the overall scene appears relatively stable, suggesting the person was standing still rather than moving."
23,1498121429100,1498121439090,Walking,Still,"1) The foreground and background elements in the photo do not show pronounced motion blur or repetitive rhythmic displacement that would suggest walking or running. 2) There are no visible features of a car interior (e.g. dashboard, seats), making a car scenario unlikely. 3) The composition of the image appears relatively stable, indicating the subject is not in active motion. 4) Consequently, 'Still' is the most consistent category with the given visual evidence."
24,1498121439100,1498121449090,Walking,Still,"From the photo, we primarily see the wearer's skin in the foreground and a wooden fence in the background. There are no clear indicators of movement—such as motion blur or a sense of forward progress—that might indicate walking or running. The imagery also does not suggest being inside a vehicle (no visible interior, dashboard, or seat). Given these observations, the most likely category for the person's activity is that they are not moving, i.e., 'Still.'"
25,1498121449100,1498121459090,Walking,Still,"From the image, we see a fence in the background and an arm or torso in the foreground, but no clear indication of motion. There is no motion blur nor any signs of rapid movement or being inside a vehicle. The framing suggests the camera (worn on the torso) is relatively steady rather than bouncing or vibrating, which would be more indicative of walking, running, or driving in a car. Consequently, the most likely category is that the person is standing (Still)."
26,1498121459100,1498121469090,Walking,Still,"From the image alone, there is no visible motion-related blur nor a typical car interior that would suggest driving. The camera appears close to the person’s body with a fence in the background, and there is little context indicating walking or running (e.g., distinct motion blur or surrounding motion cues). Consequently, the most likely classification given this scene is that the person is not actively moving, hence 'Still.'"
27,1498121469100,1498121479090,Walking,Walking,"From this single frame, there is no indication of being inside a car (no windshield, dashboard, or vehicle interior visible), nor is there a strong motion blur that would suggest running. It also does not seem that the camera is completely stationary (as if the person were simply standing). Given the sidewalk view, the slight tilt of the camera, and the typical body-mounted vantage, walking is the most likely form of transportation."
28,1498121479100,1498121489090,Walking,Walking,"1) The viewpoint is outdoors on what appears to be a sidewalk or residential street, rather than the interior of a vehicle. 2) The camera is worn on the torso, and the image shows a slight tilt with part of the person’s arm visible, suggesting the person is in motion. 3) There is no obvious motion blur that would indicate running, nor any signs of being stationary (e.g., a static vantage point). 4) Hence, the most likely activity is walking."
29,1498121489100,1498121499090,Walking,Walking,"From the photo, it appears the camera is positioned around torso height, pointed outward toward the street and houses. The presence of the individual's arm in the frame at an angle suggests the person is moving rather than standing still. There is no clear sign of being inside a vehicle (like a windshield or car interior) and no pronounced motion blur that would typically occur with running. Hence, walking is the most likely form of transportation."
30,1498121499100,1498121509090,Walking,Walking,"From the viewpoint in the photo, the camera appears to be near sidewalk level but still some distance above the ground (consistent with a torso-mounted camera). The building and door are quite close to the photographer, and we see the pavement directly underfoot rather than a road or farther distance typical if one were in a vehicle. There is no strong blur or fast-paced motion indicator that would suggest running or driving in a car. These clues together support that the person is walking."
1559,1498149178160,1498149188150,Run,Walking,"From the visible portion of the ground, we can see a slight but not extreme motion blur. This suggests moderate movement rather than stationary (no blur) or very rapid travel (which would cause stronger or more uniform streaking, common in running or driving). The blur patterns appear more consistent with a gentle up-and-down oscillation from footsteps, indicating walking rather than running or being in a car."
1560,1498149188160,1498149198150,Run,Walking,"1) The camera is angled downward, capturing part of the person’s clothing at the top and the ground/vegetation at the bottom, suggesting it is mounted close to the torso.
2) The image shows mild blur rather than the more pronounced blur typical of running or riding in a fast-moving car. If this had been a car ride, we would expect to see clearer indications of a car interior or stronger horizontal motion blur.
3) Although slightly blurred, it does not appear completely still, which would be more stable and in-focus if the person were not moving.
4) Overall, the subtle motion in the frame is consistent with a walking pace."
1561,1498149198160,1498149208150,Run,Walking,"The image is taken from a torso-mounted perspective pointing downward toward the ground, showing partial blur but no clear indications of high-speed travel or a stationary position. While there is some motion blur, it is not so pronounced as to suggest running; nor is there any obvious sign of an interior space (such as window or dashboard) that would indicate being in a vehicle. Overall, the moderate motion blur and the ground-level perspective are most consistent with the person walking."
1562,1498149208160,1498149218150,Run,Walking,"1) The camera view suggests it is roughly at torso height and angled downward, capturing part of the ground and vegetation at the edge of a sidewalk or road. 2) There is some motion blur but not enough to indicate high speed (e.g. running or driving in a car). 3) The overall perspective and moderate shake are consistent with a person walking rather than standing still, running, or riding in a car."
1563,1498149218160,1498149228150,Run,Car,"1) The photo exhibits pronounced motion blur and a swirling effect, indicating relatively fast or smooth travel rather than a slower, step-based motion. 2) The grass and pavement seem to be passing by quickly, which suggests a higher speed typical of being inside a vehicle rather than when running or walking. 3) The blur pattern is more consistent with camera movement from a turning or moving car than the regular bobbing motion one would see from running or walking. Therefore, 'Car' is the most likely transportation method among the given options."
1564,1498149228160,1498149238150,Run,Car,"In this image, the surroundings appear significantly blurred in a sweeping or swirling pattern. Such a pronounced blur typically results from relatively high-speed motion, more consistent with vehicular travel than with walking or running. A still photo would not exhibit this level of motion blur. Hence, the most likely transportation method is 'Car.'"
1565,1498149238160,1498149248150,Run,Car,"1. The image shows strong motion blur with a swirl-like effect, suggesting rapid lateral movement or rotation. 2. The camera appears to be capturing surroundings (e.g., grass and pavement) at a speed higher than typical running or walking, implying vehicular travel. 3. The pronounced blur and wider field of motion are more consistent with being in a car than with walking or running, which typically produce a more rhythmic, up-and-down motion in footage."
1566,1498149248160,1498149258150,Run,Walking,"From the image, part of the lens appears to be blocked by a finger or hand. However, the slight blur in the background and the view of what seems to be a road or sidewalk suggest a moderate pace of movement rather than a complete stillness or the higher speed (and often more pronounced motion blur) expected while running or riding in a car. Consequently, 'Walking' best fits the observed environment and motion cues."
1567,1498149258160,1498149268150,Run,Walking,"1. The photo shows an outdoor environment with what appears to be pavement and greenery. 2. The image is partially obscured, suggesting motion-induced camera placement shifts. 3. There is mild blur but no strong indication of very rapid movement. 4. The scene does not show signs of being inside a vehicle (no visible car interior). 5. The blur level is more consistent with moderate movement rather than complete stillness or running. 6. Therefore, walking is the most likely mode of transportation."
1568,1498149268160,1498149278150,Run,Walking,"First, the photo appears to be taken outdoors, with what looks like pavement or ground and some vegetation at the right edge. Second, the perspective (torso-mounted camera) and slight blur suggest a moderate level of motion rather than complete stillness or high-speed travel. In particular, no evident interior car features or strong indications of high velocity (which might be seen in a car) are visible. The image does not show the pronounced, rapid shaking usually associated with running. Consequently, the most likely mode of transportation, given the mild blur and outdoor context, is that the person is walking."
1569,1498149278160,1498149288150,Run,Run,"From the photo, the ground appears highly blurred and the image has a pronounced motion ‘swirl.’ A torso-mounted camera typically bounces more vigorously at a running pace than when walking, and the pronounced blur suggests faster movement than walking or standing still. It also does not appear to be a view through a car window or interior, so among the listed categories, running is the most likely activity."
1570,1498149288160,1498149298150,Run,Walking,"1) The image shows the ground viewed from a slightly downward angle with noticeable motion blur. 2) The blur suggests the camera (attached at torso height) is moving but not so quickly as to indicate running or vehicular speed. 3) There are no clear signs of a vehicle interior (e.g., window frames, dashboard) that would imply a car. 4) The motion blur is moderate rather than extreme, which is more consistent with walking than either standing still or running. Therefore, 'Walking' is the most likely transportation method."
1571,1498149298160,1498149308150,Run,Walking,"1) The image shows a view of the ground at close range, suggesting the camera is near an upright pedestrian’s torso rather than within a car or remaining still. 2) There is mild, uneven blur across the image, which is consistent with the natural bobbing motion of walking (as opposed to a more intense, rapid blur if running, or a steady/view-distanced background if riding in a car). 3) The portion of clothing visible near the top implies a lower vantage typical of someone moving on foot. Together, these signs indicate the user is most likely walking."
1572,1498149308160,1498149318150,Run,Run,"From the blurred swirls and the apparent vigorous bobbing captured by a torso-mounted camera, it appears the person is moving quickly on foot. The surroundings (outdoor path) and intense motion blur—especially noticeable around the arm and the ground—are consistent with the jostling effect of running rather than the more subdued movements of walking or the relative steadiness of being in a car."
1573,1498149318160,1498149328150,Run,Run,"The heavy motion blur in the foreground and background suggests fast and continuous torso movement, which is more characteristic of running than walking (which typically shows less blur). The image appears to be taken outdoors rather than inside a vehicle, and the rapid changes in camera orientation (as implied by the strong blur) further support that the person is running rather than still or walking."
1574,1498149328160,1498149338150,Run,Run,"1) The image shows significant motion blur around both the ground and the arm, indicating rapid movement rather than slow or stationary activity. 2) The vantage point (camera at torso-level) and the lack of any visible vehicle interior suggest that the person is not inside a car. 3) The pronounced blur of the surroundings is more consistent with the quicker pace of running rather than walking. Therefore, the best match is 'Run'."
1575,1498149338160,1498149348150,Run,Car,"1) The image is markedly blurred in a smooth, swirled way, rather than in the regular up-down jostle one might see from running or walking. 2) The hand placement near what could be part of a seat or console suggests a seated position. 3) The overall pattern of motion blur—appearing more rotational or sweeping rather than the regular bobbing that comes from walking or running—also points toward vehicular movement. 4) Consequently, the most likely mode of transportation given these visual cues is that the person is in a car."
1576,1498149348160,1498149358150,Run,Car,"The image appears to show an interior environment with a hand near what looks like a seat or seat belt area, and the background is blurred in a way often seen from inside a vehicle. This swirl-like blur suggests motion without the pronounced vertical bounce typical of walking or running. In addition, the presence of what seems to be an upholstered surface and the partial view of a hand in a position consistent with gripping a steering wheel or similar object reinforces the likelihood that the person is riding in (or driving) a car rather than walking, running, or standing still."
1577,1498149358160,1498149368150,Run,Walking,"1) The image shows a moderate blur or swirl in the background, indicative of movement but not at a very high speed (which would typically produce more pronounced or streaky motion blur). 2) The person's hand in the foreground is relatively stable; this suggests the camera is not being jostled as violently as when running, yet it isn’t stationary. 3) No clear signs of a car interior (like windows, seats, or dashboard) are visible, making ‘Car’ less likely. 4) The mild but noticeable camera motion blur is consistent with walking pace rather than standing still."
1578,1498149368160,1498149378150,Run,Run,"1. The image shows a blurred foreground (the hand and a water bottle) and a road in the background, indicating that the camera is bouncing or moving quickly. 2. There is no visible vehicle interior or windshield, which makes travel by car less likely. 3. Holding a water bottle in hand and the pronounced motion blur suggest a jogging or running action rather than a slow, steady pace. 4. Given the categories (Still, Walking, Run, Car), these clues best match a 'Run' scenario."
1579,1498149378160,1498149388150,Run,Run,"From the photo, we can see that the foreground is blurred and the camera perspective (torso-mounted) shows a hand holding what appears to be a water bottle. The background (the road surface and nearby grass) is also blurred in a way that implies relatively fast, continuous movement rather than a gentle walking pace. Further, there is no visible interior (such as a car dashboard or seat) that would indicate being inside a vehicle. The degree of blur and the fact that the person is apparently carrying a drink container are common visuals during running, which leads to the conclusion that the person is running."
1580,1498149388160,1498149398150,Run,Run,"1) The camera seems to be torso-mounted outdoors, with no visible car interior. 2) The image shows a roadway and nearby vegetation, but the viewer’s perspective is close to the ground and not inside a vehicle. 3) There is a water bottle in the subject’s hand, which is more typical of running or walking than driving in a car. 4) The background and subject's hand show noticeable motion blur that is consistent with the bouncing movement of running rather than slow-paced walking. 5) Thus, the most likely category is 'Run'."
1581,1498149398160,1498149408150,Run,Run,"The viewpoint suggests that the camera is bouncing at a faster pace than a walk, evidenced by the motion blur on the road surface. The arm is held out with a water bottle, which is typical when a person is on the move but not enclosed in a car. The ground appears relatively close, which would be unusual inside a vehicle. The amount of blur is most consistent with running, rather than walking or being still, and no visible signs indicate car transport."
1582,1498149408160,1498149418150,Run,Run,"From the torso-mounted camera perspective, the ground appears significantly blurred and the arm holding the water bottle is steady in the foreground. Such pronounced background blur suggests more rapid movement than walking, while the view does not show any interior frame or window typical of a car ride. Consequently, the most likely transportation method is running."
1583,1498149418160,1498149428150,Run,Run,"1) The camera angle (looking down toward the arm and the road) suggests a chest-mounted perspective in open air. 2) The road surface appears blurred, indicating moderate to fast movement. 3) The person is holding a sports-style water bottle, commonly used during more vigorous activity. 4) There is no indication of being inside a vehicle (e.g., no car interior visible), and the blurring is too pronounced to be typical walking. 5) The overall evidence (pavement blur, body position, and water bottle usage) points most strongly to running."
1584,1498149428160,1498149438150,Run,Walking,"From the image, there is moderate motion blur suggesting movement, but it does not appear so rapid as to be running (where we might expect more intense vertical bouncing) nor does it show a vehicle interior or high-speed surroundings typical of being in a car. Likewise, it is not stationary. Thus, walking is the most likely conclusion."
1585,1498149438160,1498149448150,Run,Walking,"From the image, the scene is slightly blurred and appears to show the ground in the background with a portion of the person's arm or hand covering part of the frame. The blur is not excessively strong (which might suggest running or vehicle travel), but it does indicate some movement. There is no clear indication of being inside a vehicle (e.g., windows, dashboard), and the motion blur is relatively mild. Therefore, the most likely classification based on the subtle motion blur and visible ground is that the person is walking."
1586,1498149448160,1498149458150,Run,Walking,"In this photo, we see a predominantly blurred, close-up pinkish area (likely an arm or hand) and the ground faintly visible below. The vantage point and moderate blur suggest the camera is moving but not at a high velocity (as one might expect when running or traveling by car). There is also no clear indication of being stationary. Taken together, these cues point to a walking motion rather than running, driving, or standing still."
1587,1498149458160,1498149468150,Run,Walking,"1) The image is dominated by a uniform, streaked blur rather than a stationary or sharply defined scene, suggesting the camera (attached to the torso) was in motion. 2) The blur appears somewhat smooth and sweeping rather than extremely random or chaotic, which is more consistent with walking than the sharper jolts typically associated with running. 3) No features indicative of vehicle travel (such as a car interior or road view) are visible, further supporting that the most likely mode of transportation is walking."
1588,1498149468160,1498149478150,Run,Run,"1) The image is dominated by pronounced, sweeping motion blur, suggesting rapid camera movement. 2) The blur is fairly uniform and doesn’t reveal any typical car interior or stable background details, so it’s unlikely to be a still or car setting. 3) Walking usually yields lighter or more moderate movement blur, but these strong streaks imply faster, more vigorous motion. 4) Hence, the most plausible conclusion, given this single blurred frame, is that the camera wearer is running."
162,1498123358570,1498123368560,Car,Car,"From the image, we see the vantage point appears to be behind another car and aligned with street-level traffic. The camera's viewpoint is relatively steady and at a height typical of a passenger or driver inside a vehicle, rather than someone standing, walking, or running. No discernible signs (such as motion blur from footsteps or the body’s up-and-down motion) indicate walking or running. Consequently, the most likely mode of transportation here is by car."
163,1498123368570,1498123378560,Car,Car,"From the photo, the vantage point appears to be through an automobile’s rear or side glass, and there's another car's brake lights directly in front. The camera perspective suggests the person is in a seated position higher off the ground than if running or walking, and there is no sign of active foot movement or significant motion blur. Thus, taking into account the view and environment details (tall building, car ahead, road scene), it is most consistent with traveling by car."
164,1498123378570,1498123388560,Car,Car,"In the photo, a car’s rear brake lights are visible in front of the camera viewpoint, suggesting that the observer is located inside or immediately behind another vehicle. The tall building and the street scene also support the conclusion that this image was taken from a position on the road rather than from a stationary or walking/running perspective. Consequently, the most likely mode of transportation is by car."
165,1498123388570,1498123398560,Car,Car,"1) The image includes a street intersection with buildings and traffic lights viewed from a slightly upward angle, as if seen through a windshield. 2) The wavy distortion over the sky is consistent with looking through a car window rather than simply standing outdoors. 3) There is no apparent motion blur or jostling that would be expected if walking or running with a chest-mounted camera. 4) These clues together most strongly suggest that the person is traveling by car rather than being still, walking, or running."
166,1498123398570,1498123408560,Car,Car,"1) The image is shot at an upward angle, suggesting the camera is positioned behind (or near) a windshield rather than at typical walking or running eye level. 2) The overall scene is relatively stable with no evident motion blur typical of running or even walking; the wavy lines seem more like a windshield or sensor artifact than rapid bodily movement. 3) The context shows a street environment with vehicles and traffic lights, supporting the likelihood of the photographer being inside a car. Thus, “Car” is the inferred transportation method."
167,1498123408570,1498123418560,Car,Car,"1. The overall frame shows an urban streetscape viewed from a somewhat enclosed or filtered perspective (the wavy distortion is consistent with looking through a windshield or window). 2. The camera angle is pitched upward in a way that often occurs when seated inside a car rather than standing in the open (no direct sight of ground or legs, and the foreground suggests a windshield-like sheen). 3. There is no obvious motion blur or footstep bob (as one might see with walking or running), and it does not appear that the person is simply standing still in the open. 4. Taken together, these cues suggest that the photo was recorded from within a vehicle rather than on foot."
168,1498123418570,1498123428560,Car,Car,"From the photo viewpoint, we see the tops of surrounding buildings and a van ahead at what appears to be roughly driver or passenger car height. The angle and perspective suggest the camera is held at a relatively fixed, vehicle‐appropriate vantage point rather than the dynamic up‐and‐down motion indicative of walking or running. Additionally, street traffic and the presence of brake lights ahead are characteristic of being inside or aboard a vehicle in traffic. Combining these observations leads to the conclusion that the mode of transportation is by car."
169,1498123428570,1498123438560,Car,Car,"1. The image is taken from a viewpoint behind traffic lights and directly behind another vehicle, suggesting the camera is in line with car traffic. 2. The horizon and surrounding buildings appear at a consistent height and angle, which is more typical of a seated position inside a vehicle than of a person walking or running. 3. The overall framing and lack of pronounced motion blur also suggest the camera is relatively stable, consistent with riding in a car rather than walking or running."
170,1498123438570,1498123448560,Car,Car,"In the image, we see an urban street scene with buildings, traffic lights, and a van immediately in front. The viewpoint is consistent with looking out from within a vehicle, as the horizon and framing suggest a forward-facing perspective from behind a windshield or similar. The scene does not show the typical bobbing movement one would expect from walking or running, and it is not stationary in the sense of being still on foot. Therefore, the available cues best match a car-based mode of transportation."
171,1498123448570,1498123458560,Car,Car,"From the image, we see the scene framed by urban buildings and other vehicles ahead (e.g. the white van). The camera angle and absence of typical walking/running motion blur suggest the photographer is not on foot. Instead, the perspective is consistent with being inside a car—likely behind or near the windshield—given the wavy distortion, vantage point above road level, and alignment behind another vehicle in traffic."

The perspective suggests the camera (on the person's torso) is inside a vehicle rather than standing, walking, or running outdoors. The horizon and relative distance to the tail of the van in front also indicate a seated, relatively higher vantage point, consistent with an in-car viewpoint. Therefore, the most likely mode of transportation in this scene is 'Car.'"
173,1498123468570,1498123478560,Car,Car,"1. The image shows what appears to be a street scene with multiple buildings, including one marked 'Lloyds Bank' on the right, and a white vehicle (van or bus) in front. 2. The camera orientation and angle suggest the viewpoint is relatively high and stable, more consistent with being seated in a car rather than walking or running (where greater movement or lower angle would be expected). 3. There is no apparent motion blur or indication that the camera is bouncing in a manner typical of running or walking. 4. Therefore, based on the overall context and stable forward-facing viewpoint on a street with other vehicles, the most likely form of transportation is by car."
174,1498123478570,1498123488560,Car,Car,"From the camera’s vantage point, the scene appears to be viewed through a window or windshield, evidenced by the subtle ‘wavy’ distortion in the sky which commonly arises from filming through glass. The angle and framing suggest the camera is positioned at approximately sitting height rather than at a walking or standing level. There is no obvious motion blur or body-induced shaking that would be typical of walking or running, and the continuous forward-facing perspective is more consistent with being inside a vehicle. As such, the most likely transportation method is ‘Car.’"

Second, we see the alignment of houses and a traffic signal in a frame that looks consistent with someone seated inside a vehicle. Finally, the slight upward angle and the presence of window reflections/waves near the top indicate the camera is likely behind glass, which further supports the idea that this was taken from within a car rather than on foot."
177,1498123508570,1498123518560,Car,Car,"In this image, the vantage point appears to be behind a glass or windshield, as suggested by the wavy pattern dominating the photo. The scene shows a traffic light and road signs at a perspective consistent with sitting inside a vehicle rather than standing on foot or running. There is no notable motion blur that might suggest running or walking, and the relatively higher viewpoint also aligns with a seated position inside a car. Therefore, the most likely mode of transportation here is by car."

The camera angle appears elevated in a way consistent with having been placed in a seat rather than walking or running. The visibility of the traffic light and road signs from a near eye-level perspective, combined with the subtle moiré effect that often arises from filming through a car window, supports the conclusion that the subject is traveling by car rather than standing still, walking, or running."

The camera appears to be viewing the surroundings through some form of transparent surface, indicated by the wavy pattern in front of the image which is consistent with viewing through a windshield. 2. The presence of a traffic light and street signs at that angle suggests the photographer is positioned at about car-driver or car-passenger height, rather than standing or walking. 3. These observations make it most likely that the photographer is traveling in a car."

If the camera were torso-mounted while walking or running, we would expect a different angle (more forward-facing and lower) and likely motion blur. Being still in an outdoor setting would similarly present a different perspective without the window distortion. Hence, the most likely category is 'Car'."

Therefore, the most likely category is 'Still.'"
184,1498123578570,1498123588560,Car,Still,"1) The image shows an upward view of trees and buildings with no evident signs of motion (e.g., no motion blur or shifting perspective).
2) We do not see any vehicle interior (which might suggest being in a car), nor do we see a dynamic ground perspective (often indicative of walking or running).
3) The photo could feasibly be taken by someone standing on the sidewalk, as it appears stationary rather than in motion.
4) Given the categories (Still, Walking, Run, Car), the most consistent match with this single frame is that the person was 'Still' (not actively moving)."

The view appears to be taken from ground level looking up toward trees and nearby buildings, with a bus in the frame but no clear indication that the camera is inside a moving vehicle. The overall scene looks stable, and without any visible evidence of running or walking motion, the most likely conclusion is that the person was standing still."

189,1498123628570,1498123638560,Car,Walking,"From the single frame, there is no direct sign of a vehicle interior or windshield, and the viewpoint appears to be an upward-facing outdoor shot without the typical boundaries or visual obstructions of a car interior. Although the image alone makes it difficult to confirm motion, the outdoor setting (buildings, streetlamps, sky) and the lack of evidence suggesting a vehicle interior align more with the person walking than being still, running, or in a car."
190,1498123638570,1498123648560,Car,Car,"From the image vantage point, we appear to be seeing the sky and nearby buildings through a patterned surface (likely a windshield or window mesh). The camera is tilted upward, suggesting the photographer is seated or positioned within an enclosed structure rather than moving on foot. There is no indication of the up-and-down or side-to-side motion typically associated with walking or running. The presence of the curved lampposts and building lines seen through a subtly distorted view further suggests being inside a car rather than standing still outdoors."
191,1498123648570,1498123658560,Car,Car,"1) The photo shows the view of an overcast sky, surrounding buildings, and streetlights from a position that appears to be behind a transparent layer with a wavy or mesh-like pattern. This suggests looking through some sort of window or windshield rather than a direct open-air vantage. 2) No noticeable motion blur or bouncing that would indicate walking or running is apparent, and the chest-level camera angle faces upward more like one would see if seated. 3) These factors together make it most plausible that the person is traveling inside a car."
