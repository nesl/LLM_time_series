**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **Y-axis**: Dominant gravity component (~8.0–8.8 m/s²) confirms the sensor’s vertical alignment. Minor dips (e.g., 7.7 m/s²) correlate with **torso motion during steps**, as walking induces rhythmic vertical acceleration changes.  
   - **X-axis**: Baseline ~4.3–5.0 m/s² with occasional peaks (e.g., 5.13 m/s²) reflects **forward acceleration from steps**, distinct from the higher, sustained spikes seen in running.  
   - **Z-axis**: Gradual rise to ~2.8 m/s² mid-sequence suggests **lateral sway** (side-to-side torso motion during walking), stabilizing as gait normalizes.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **Y-axis**: Pronounced fluctuations (−0.36 to +0.33 rad/s) indicate **torso rotation**, likely from arm swings or turning. These are rhythmic and moderate, aligning with walking, not abrupt turns (e.g., in a car).  
   - **X-axis**: Moderate variations (−0.21 to +0.26 rad/s) match **forward/backward torso tilt** during steps. Early spikes (e.g., 0.26 rad/s) may reflect gait initiation.  
   - **Z-axis**: Minimal motion (−0.12 to +0.12 rad/s) rules out significant yaw (e.g., car steering).  

3. **Magnetometer Trends**:  
   - **X-axis**: Gradual decline (−14.6 to −9.1 μT) suggests **consistent directional change** (e.g., walking along a curved path).  
   - **Y/Z-axes**: Oscillations (−25.6 to −18.8 μT in Y, −35.4 to −30.6 μT in Z) align with torso sway and orientation shifts during walking.  

4. **Activity Differentiation**:  
   - **Still**: Excluded due to x/z-axis accelerometer variability and gyroscope fluctuations.  
   - **Run**: Ruled out by moderate accelerometer magnitudes (x-axis peaks ≤5.13 m/s² vs. >10 m/s² typical for running) and lack of high-frequency step cycles.  
   - **Car**: Inconsistent with gradual magnetometer trends (cars cause rapid directional shifts) and absence of sustained gyroscope spikes from sharp turns/braking.  

**Conclusion**: The combined evidence—rhythmic accelerometer variability (steps), torso rotation (gyroscope y-axis), and gradual directional changes (magnetometer)—strongly indicates **walking with torso rotations**, likely during a curved path or periodic head/torso turns (e.g., looking sideways).","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz Sampling)

### **Activity Inference**
The data suggests **walking combined with torso rotations** (e.g., turning or checking surroundings). Key evidence:
1. **Accelerometer**: Y-axis gravity dominance + x/z-axis variability (steps/sway).
2. **Gyroscope**: Pronounced y-axis rotations (turning) and x-axis motion (steps).
3. **Magnetometer**: Gradual directional changes (consistent with walking path adjustments).

This aligns with activities like **walking in a curved path** or **periodic torso twists** (e.g., looking sideways while moving). The absence of extreme spikes rules out abrupt motions (e.g., jumping)."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Patterns (Dominant Gravity Axis):**  
   - The y-axis accelerometer data (8.05–8.45 m/s²) aligns closely with gravitational acceleration (~9.8 m/s²), indicating the smartphone is upright (y-axis gravity-aligned, e.g., in a torso-mounted position). The stable baseline with minor dips (e.g., 8.45 → 8.05) suggests slight forward/backward tilts, not locomotion.  
   - The x-axis (4.25–4.67 m/s²) and z-axis (2.05–2.87 m/s²) show no periodic oscillations or sustained peaks typical of walking/running. The z-axis variability (e.g., 2.24 → 2.81) likely reflects minor lateral shifts (e.g., breathing or posture adjustments).  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics (Low-Intensity Motion):**  
   - The y-axis gyroscope (range: -0.14–0.12 rad/s) shows abrupt negative peaks and rebounds, indicative of torso twisting or bending (e.g., seated stretches).  
   - The z-axis gyroscope (-0.07–0.09 rad/s) alternates between positive/negative values, suggesting small yaw rotations (e.g., shoulder turns), but lacks the rhythmicity of walking/running.  
   - No sustained angular velocity in any axis (e.g., <0.1 rad/s), ruling out dynamic activities like running (>1 rad/s for torso rotation) or vehicular motion (e.g., turning).  

3. **Magnetometer Stability (Fixed Heading):**  
   - Magnetometer x/y/z axes show minimal variability (e.g., y-axis: -18.8–-21.4 µT with slight drift). This confirms the person’s heading remained largely unchanged, inconsistent with vehicular motion (e.g., car turns) or walking/running (minor but detectable heading fluctuations).  

4. **Absence of Locomotion Signatures:**  
   - Walking/running would produce periodic accelerometer peaks (step frequency ~1–3 Hz) and higher gyroscope magnitudes (e.g., >0.5 rad/s for hip rotation). The accelerometer lacks such periodicity, and gyroscope peaks are sporadic and low-magnitude.  
   - Vehicular motion (e.g., car acceleration/turns) would cause sustained accelerometer deviations (e.g., x/z-axis spikes) and magnetometer heading changes, neither of which are observed.  

**Conclusion:**  
The combined sensor trends—gravity-dominated accelerometer, low-intensity gyroscope activity, and stable magnetometer—indicate the person was **stationary** (Still) with occasional torso adjustments (e.g., seated stretches, posture corrections). No evidence of walking, running, or vehicular movement exists in the data.","### Analysis of IMU Sensor Data Trends

### **Summary of Key Observations**  
1. **Activity Type**:  
   - Likely **stationary with torso adjustments** (e.g., sitting/standing with posture shifts, twisting, or bending). No clear walking/running signatures (no periodic accelerometer peaks).  

2. **Dominant Motion Axes**:  
   - **Accelerometer**: y-axis (gravity-aligned), z-axis (lateral motion).  
   - **Gyroscope**: y-axis (pitch/twist), z-axis (yaw).  

3. **Sensor Noise/Drift**:  
   - Accelerometer z-axis shows high variability, possibly due to subtle movements.  
   - Gyroscope y-axis has abrupt changes, suggesting intentional motions rather than noise.  

4. **Orientation**:  
   - Magnetometer stability implies minimal heading changes. Accelerometer y-axis dominance suggests the smartphone’s y-axis aligns with gravity (e.g., upright in a pocket).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The data corresponds to **low-intensity torso movements** (e.g., seated stretches, posture corrections, or light twisting) without significant locomotion. The gyroscope y-axis activity and accelerometer z-axis variability are key markers of motion. Magnetometer trends confirm a largely fixed heading."
37,1498121583330,1498121593320,Still,Walking,"<<Walking>>  
**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **Vertical (Y-axis):**  
  - Values (~8.1–8.6 m/s²) are slightly below gravity (9.8 m/s²), indicating **vertical torso motion** (e.g., up/down movement during steps). The stability of this axis rules out high-impact activities like running.  
  - Minor fluctuations (e.g., peak at 8.588 m/s²) suggest rhythmic vertical shifts, consistent with **walking cadence**.  

- **Forward/Backward (X-axis):**  
  - Gradual decline (4.54 → ~4.18 m/s²) with oscillations reflects **forward motion** (e.g., torso leaning forward during steps). The periodic nature matches step cycles, not static postures (Still) or erratic car motion.  

- **Lateral (Z-axis):**  
  - High variability (2.2–2.95 m/s²) indicates **torso sway** or lateral adjustments during walking. Sharp dips/peaks (e.g., 2.19 → 2.95) align with lateral weight shifts, unlike the steadier Z-axis expected in a car or Still.  

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **Lateral Rotation (Y-axis):**  
  - Largest range (-0.10 to +0.16 rad/s) with spikes (e.g., 0.16 rad/s) corresponds to **torso bending** during steps. This matches walking mechanics (hip rotation), not the minimal motion of Still or the sustained rotations of a car.  

- **Forward/Backward (X-axis) and Vertical (Z-axis):**  
  - Low-magnitude fluctuations (X: ±0.07 rad/s; Z: ±0.03 rad/s) suggest minor tilting and sporadic twists (e.g., heading adjustments). These are too subtle for running or car turns but align with walking posture shifts.  

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- All axes show **gradual, smooth shifts** (e.g., X: -11.6 → -8.4 µT; Y: -21.2 → -18.6 µT), indicating slow orientation changes relative to Earth’s magnetic field. This is consistent with **walking in a fixed direction** (e.g., indoors), not rapid turns (Car) or static orientation (Still).  

### **Eliminating Other Activities**  
- **Still:** Requires minimal accelerometer variability (gravity-dominated Y-axis only) and near-zero gyroscope activity. The observed oscillations and rotational spikes rule this out.  
- **Run:** High-intensity accelerometer peaks (>10 m/s²) and gyroscope spikes (>0.5 rad/s) would occur. The data shows moderate, rhythmic motion instead.  
- **Car:** Magnetometer would show sharp directional changes (e.g., turns), and accelerometer/gyroscope would reflect sustained vibrations or irregular motion (e.g., braking/acceleration). The gradual trends and periodicity here are inconsistent with vehicular movement.  

### **Conclusion**  
The combined **rhythmic accelerometer oscillations**, **torso-bending gyroscope spikes**, and **gradual magnetometer shifts** strongly indicate **Walking** in a controlled environment (e.g., indoor walking with minor heading adjustments).","### Analysis of IMU Sensor Data Trends and Distributions

  - **Z-axis (Vertical Rotation)**:
    - Small baseline values (**-0.03 to +0.03 rad/s**) but spikes (e.g., **0.036 rad/s**), suggesting intermittent turning (e.g., torso twists).

- **Trend Distribution**:
  - Y-axis: Dominant rotational activity with sharp spikes.
  - X-axis: Low-magnitude tilting motions.
  - Z-axis: Minor rotational noise with occasional turns.

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Data**
- **Key Observations**:
  - All axes show **gradual shifts** (no sharp discontinuities), likely due to orientation changes relative to Earth’s magnetic field:
    - **X-axis**: **-11.6 to -8.4 µT** (lateral orientation shifts).
    - **Y-axis**: **-21.2 to -18.6 µT** (forward/backward alignment changes).
    - **Z-axis**: **-35.1 to -31.6 µT** (vertical field variations).
  - Noisy but stable trends, consistent with slow torso reorientations (e.g., walking in a fixed direction with minor heading adjustments).

- **Trend Distribution**:
  - Smooth, non-periodic variations across axes, indicating gradual orientation changes.

---

### **Summary of Main Elements**
1. **Accelerometer**:
   - Vertical (Y-axis) dominance with gravity influence.
   - Lateral (Z-axis) dynamics suggest torso sway or phone rotation.
   - Forward/backward (X-axis) oscillations align with stepping or posture shifts.

2. **Gyroscope**:
   - Significant lateral bending (Y-axis) and sporadic torso twists (Z-axis).
   - Low-intensity tilting (X-axis) implies stable forward motion.

3. **Magnetometer**:
   - Gradual orientation changes, consistent with walking in a controlled environment (indoors).

---

### **Activity Inference**
The combined trends suggest **walking with periodic torso sway**, occasional bending (e.g., adjusting posture), and minor heading adjustments. The absence of extreme spikes rules out high-intensity activities (e.g., running or jumping). Magnetometer stability implies minimal environmental interference, likely a structured indoor setting."
38,1498121593330,1498121603320,Still,Still,"<<Still>>  
**Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Data**:  
   - The **y-axis** (vertical) shows a stable gravity component (~8.1–8.7 m/s²), indicating the torso remained upright without significant vertical displacement (e.g., bouncing during walking/running).  
   - **z-axis** variations (decline to 1.85 m/s² and recovery) suggest a single forward tilt (e.g., bending) followed by postural recovery, but no repetitive motion.  
   - **x-axis** stability (~4.3 m/s² baseline) rules out lateral swaying or rhythmic steps.  

2. **Gyroscope Data**:  
   - **y-axis** spikes (-0.209 to 0.162 rad/s) indicate isolated pitch rotations (forward/backward bending), not sustained angular motion (e.g., leg swings during walking/running).  
   - Minimal **x/z-axis** activity (±0.05 rad/s) confirms absence of balance adjustments or turns.  

3. **Magnetometer Data**:  
   - Sharp **x-axis** dips (e.g., -13.8 µT) correlate with torso orientation changes during bending, not vehicular motion (which would show chaotic magnetic field shifts).  
   - **y/z-axis** stability aligns with Earth’s magnetic field, inconsistent with car-induced directional changes.  

4. **Activity Inference**:  
   - **No rhythmic patterns** in accelerometer/gyroscope data exclude Walking/Run.  
   - **Single torso movement** (bending/recovery) lacks the sustained vibrations or directional shifts typical of Car motion.  
   - **Vertical stability** and transient spikes align with a stationary posture (Still) interrupted by a brief, deliberate motion (e.g., picking up an object).  

**Conclusion**: The data reflects a **stationary posture (Still)** with a single torso adjustment, inconsistent with Walking, Run, or Car dynamics.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis  
The IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) collected from a torso-mounted smartphone over 10 seconds (10 Hz sampling) reveals distinct trends and variations. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements and their distributions:  

---

  - Baseline: **~4.3–4.4 m/s²** (stable gravity component).  
  - **Spikes**: Peaks at **4.61 m/s²** (e.g., sample 21: 4.521) and drops to **4.12 m/s²** (sample 23: 4.127).

- **z-axis**:  
  - **Dynamic range**: **1.85–2.85 m/s²**, with a **downward trend** early (2.85 → 1.85) and recovery later (2.6+).  
  - **Interpretation**: Likely reflects forward/backward torso tilting (e.g., bending or recovering posture).  

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Data**  
**Key Observations**:  
- **x-axis**:  
  - **Minor fluctuations**: Mostly **±0.05 rad/s**, except spikes at **0.106 rad/s** (sample 37) and **-0.092 rad/s** (sample 23).  
  - **Activity**: Brief rotational motions (e.g., shoulder adjustments).  

- **y-axis**:  
  - **Large variability**: Peaks at **-0.209 rad/s** (backward rotation) and **0.162 rad/s** (forward rotation).  
  - **Dominant trend**: Significant pitch rotations (e.g., torso bending forward/backward).  

- **z-axis**:  
  - **Subtle changes**: Mostly **±0.05 rad/s**, with minor yaw rotations (e.g., turning left/right).  

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Data**  
**Key Observations**:  
- **x-axis**:  
  - Baseline: **-9.8 to -11.8 µT**, with dips to **-13.8 µT** (samples 45–50).  
  - **Trend**: Sharp drops correlate with torso orientation changes (e.g., leaning forward).  

- **y-axis**:  
  - **Stable field**: **-19.5 to -21.5 µT**, consistent with Earth’s horizontal magnetic field.  

- **z-axis**:  
  - **Strong field**: **-31 to -34 µT**, typical of Earth’s vertical component. Minor dips suggest tilt-induced variations.  

---

### **Activity Inference**  
1. **Accelerometer**:  
   - **Vertical stability** (y-axis gravity dominance) suggests upright posture.  
   - **z-axis decline/recovery** indicates forward bending followed by recovery.  

2. **Gyroscope**:  
   - **Pitch rotations** (y-axis spikes) align with bending motions.  
   - Minor roll (x-axis) and yaw (z-axis) imply compensatory balance adjustments.  

3. **Magnetometer**:  
   - Orientation shifts (e.g., bending) correlate with x/z-axis magnetic field changes.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **a dynamic torso movement sequence**, likely involving:  
- **Forward bending** (accelerometer z-axis decline, gyroscope y-axis spikes).  
- **Postural recovery** (z-axis accelerometer rebound, magnetometer stabilization).  
- Minor lateral shifts and rotations for balance.  

This pattern aligns with activities like **picking up an object, sit-to-stand motions, or controlled torso exercises**. The absence of rhythmic oscillations (e.g., walking) suggests a single, deliberate movement."
39,1498121603330,1498121613320,Still,Still,"<<Still>>  
**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Dominance in Y-axis:** The y-axis accelerometer values (~8.3–8.4 m/s²) align closely with gravity, indicating an upright torso posture. The slight deviation from 9.8 m/s² suggests minor tilts or vertical adjustments, but no sustained motion (e.g., walking/running). The gradual downward trend in the x-axis (4.38 → 4.17 m/s²) and high z-axis variability (sharp peaks) reflect sporadic torso shifts (e.g., leaning, lateral adjustments), not rhythmic locomotion.  

2. **Gyroscope Spikes Without Rhythm:** The gyroscope shows sporadic rotational spikes (e.g., x-axis peak of 0.123 rad/s at sample 55) and y-axis fluctuations (–0.083 to 0.143 rad/s), consistent with brief torso reorientations (e.g., turning, reaching, balancing). However, the lack of periodic angular velocity patterns rules out cyclic activities like walking/running.  

3. **Magnetometer Stability:** The magnetometer z-axis (–31.9 to –34.3 µT) remains stable, indicating minimal heading changes. This aligns with a stationary activity where the torso maintains alignment with Earth’s magnetic field (e.g., standing still).  

4. **No Periodic Signals:** The accelerometer and gyroscope lack the harmonic oscillations (e.g., step cycles) characteristic of walking/running. Car motion would typically show sustained lateral accelerations or rotational noise (e.g., turns, vibrations), which are absent here.  

**Conclusion:** The data reflects a **stationary posture** (upright stance) with intermittent torso adjustments (e.g., leaning, minor twists), consistent with the ""Still"" category.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10 Seconds)

- **y-axis Dominance**: The y-axis (range ~7.3–9.5 m/s²) shows sustained values (~8.3–8.6 m/s²), consistent with vertical oscillations during **walking**. The sharp spike (7.38 → 9.2 m/s² at samples 59–60) aligns with a sudden vertical motion (e.g., lifting a leg higher during a step or minor postural adjustment).  
- **x/z-axis Variability**:  
  - **x-axis** (~4.0–4.9 m/s²) has moderate fluctuations, reflecting lateral torso shifts during steps.  
  - **z-axis** (~1.6–2.9 m/s²) shows high variability, matching vertical torso oscillations (e.g., heel strikes and toe-offs).  
  - **No running-level intensity**: Peak magnitudes (e.g., x: 4.98 m/s², z: 2.88 m/s²) are lower than typical running thresholds (>6 m/s² in x/z axes).  

### **2. Gyroscope Spikes**  
- **x-axis rotations** (-0.4 to 0.24 rad/s) include sharp negative/positive spikes (e.g., -0.4 rad/s at sample 57), indicating torso turns (e.g., changing direction while walking).  
- **y-axis tilt** (-0.33 to 0.25 rad/s) features a large negative spike (-0.28 rad/s at sample 85), likely forward/backward adjustments (e.g., leaning to recover balance mid-walk).  
- **z-axis** remains near-zero (-0.11 to 0.09 rad/s), ruling out sustained twisting (e.g., car steering).  

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **Directional shifts**:  
  - **x-axis** declines from -10 → -13 µT (samples 70–75), **y-axis** decreases from -21 → -24 µT (samples 45–55), and **z-axis** trends downward (-33 → -34.8 µT). These correlate with torso rotations (e.g., turning north to south).  
  - Alignment with gyroscope x/y spikes confirms **directional changes during walking**, not static or vehicular motion.  

### **4. Ruling Out Other Activities**  
- **Still**: High accelerometer/gyroscope variability contradicts static postures.  
- **Run**: Accelerometer peaks (x: 4.98 m/s², y: 9.5 m/s²) are below running thresholds (e.g., y-axis >12 m/s² for running).  
- **Car**: Magnetometer trends (slow, sustained directional shifts) and torso-centric gyroscope spikes conflict with vehicular motion (smooth, large-radius turns and engine vibrations).  

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **walking with directional turns** and minor postural adjustments. Accelerometer variability and gyroscope/magnetometer coordination confirm human locomotion, while intensity levels and sensor trends exclude running, stillness, or vehicular motion.","The IMU data collected from the torso-mounted smartphone reveals distinct trends in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings, reflecting dynamic torso movements.

   - Likely **walking with directional turns** (gyroscope x/y spikes correlate with magnetometer trends).  
   - Sudden vertical motion (accelerometer y-axis spike) suggests a **postural adjustment** (e.g., standing, stumbling).  

2. **Sensor Coordination**:  
   - Gyroscope spikes align with magnetometer orientation shifts, confirming torso rotations.  
   - Accelerometer z-axis variability matches vertical torso oscillations during motion.  

3. **Noise/Artifacts**:  
   - Magnetometer noise (e.g., sample 93: z-axis -34.8 µT) may indicate environmental interference (e.g., metal objects).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **moderate-intensity human motion** involving walking, turns, and postural adjustments.

The IMU data suggests the person was likely in a **Car**, based on the following analysis:  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **x-axis**: The gradual decline from ~4.5 m/s² to **3.93 m/s²** aligns with **deceleration** (e.g., braking or slowing down). This is typical in a car during stops or speed adjustments.  
- **y-axis**: The stable baseline (~8.0–8.5 m/s²) with minor fluctuations indicates **gravity alignment** (upright torso posture), consistent with sitting in a vehicle. The spike to **8.59 m/s²** could reflect vertical jolts from road bumps.  
- **z-axis**: Peaks (e.g., **3.1 m/s²**) and drops (**2.1 m/s²**) suggest **lateral sway**, such as during turns or lane changes.  

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **x-axis**: Sudden spikes (**0.248 rad/s**) correlate with **torso rotation**, likely caused by sharp steering maneuvers or body shifts during turns.  
- **y-axis**: The terminal negative spike (**-0.312 rad/s**) hints at **rapid backward motion**, such as braking-induced forward tilt followed by recovery.  
- **z-axis**: Sustained negative drift (**-0.075 rad/s**) indicates **prolonged turning** (e.g., navigating a curve or roundabout), matching car motion.  

### **3. Magnetometer Stability**  
- **Trends**: Gradual weakening in the y-axis and stable x/z axes suggest **controlled reorientation** (e.g., changing heading during driving). The absence of erratic fluctuations rules out activities like running or walking.  

### **Activity Correlation**  
- **Deceleration and Acceleration**: Matches car speed changes (e.g., stopping at traffic lights).  
- **Lateral Sway and Turns**: Consistent with vehicle steering and lane shifts.  
- **Controlled Reorientation**: Aligns with smooth turns and heading adjustments in a car.  

### **Eliminating Other Activities**  
- **Still**: Requires minimal motion; ruled out by gyroscope spikes and accelerometer trends.  
- **Walking/Running**: Lack of periodic step-related oscillations (e.g., ~1–2 Hz cadence) in accelerometer/gyroscope data.  
- **Household Tasks**: Magnetometer stability and motion magnitude better fit vehicular movement.  

**Conclusion**: The combined IMU trends strongly align with **Car** activity, characterized by deceleration, lateral sway, and controlled turns.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Trends and Key Elements

2. **Mid-Sequence Motion**:  
   - Peaks in z-axis acceleration (**3.1 m/s²**) and y-axis gyroscope (**0.163 rad/s**) imply **forward bending**.  
   - Sharp x-axis gyroscope spike (**0.248 rad/s**) suggests **twisting motion** (e.g., checking surroundings).  
3. **Terminal Phase**:  
   - Accelerometer z-axis drop (**2.1 m/s²**) and gyroscope y-axis spike (**-0.312 rad/s**) hint at **rapid backward motion** (e.g., sitting down).  
   - Magnetometer stability supports controlled reorientation (no erratic turns).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The user likely performed **a sequence of controlled torso movements**: upright posture → bending/twisting → sitting down. The IMU data aligns with activities like **household tasks** (e.g., picking up objects, adjusting posture) or **light exercise** (e.g., stretching)."

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **x-axis (Forward Motion):**  
  - A sharp spike to **5.83 m/s²** (sample 15) followed by sustained oscillations (~4.7–5.1 m/s²) indicates **repetitive forward acceleration**, characteristic of **step initiation and stride cycles** during walking. The magnitude is lower than running (which typically exceeds 6–8 m/s²) but higher than ""Still"" or ""Car"" (which would lack rhythmic spikes).  
  - **Periodicity:** Oscillations align with a step frequency of ~1–2 Hz (10-second window), matching human walking cadence.  

- **y-axis (Vertical Motion):**  
  - Baseline ~8.0 m/s² confirms gravity alignment (device upright). Dips (e.g., 7.55 m/s²) and peaks (8.55 m/s²) correlate with **vertical torso oscillations during steps** (upward motion during heel strike, downward during mid-stance).  

- **z-axis (Lateral Motion):**  
  - Mid-period spike (**3.27 m/s²**) and irregular dips suggest **side-to-step weight shifts**, common in walking but absent in ""Still"" or ""Car.""  

### **2. Gyroscope Patterns**  
- **y-axis (Pitch):**  
  - Dominant variability (**-0.38 to 0.36 rad/s**) reflects **forward/backward torso tilts** during walking (e.g., leaning forward to initiate motion, recovering posture). This is absent in ""Still"" and less rhythmic in ""Car.""  
- **x-axis (Roll):**  
  - Minor negative spikes (**-0.36 rad/s**) suggest slight torso imbalances during steps, inconsistent with rigid ""Car"" motion.  
- **z-axis (Yaw):**  
  - Minimal activity (**-0.13 to 0.15 rad/s**) rules out twisting motions (e.g., turning in a car).  

### **3. Magnetometer Stability**  
- Smooth, gradual variations in all axes indicate **stable heading**, consistent with walking straight. ""Car"" would show sharper magnetic fluctuations during turns, while ""Still"" would have near-constant values.

- **Still:** No significant accelerometer oscillations or gyroscope pitch variability.  
- **Run:** Higher x-axis acceleration peaks (>6 m/s²) and faster step frequency (>2.5 Hz) expected.

  - **z-axis:** Stable around **-30.0 to -34.0 μT**.  
  - **Trend:** Smooth variations imply **consistent heading with minor orientation shifts** (no sharp turns).  

---

### **Key Observations**

   - Likely **walking or rhythmic torso movements** (evident from periodic acceleration spikes and pitch gyroscope activity).  
   - The sharp x-axis acceleration spike (5.83 m/s²) and y-axis gyroscope peak (0.36 rad/s) suggest a **vigorous motion** (e.g., step initiation or posture correction).  

2. **Device Orientation:**  
   - Persistent y-axis accelerometer baseline (~8.0 m/s²) implies the smartphone’s y-axis is **aligned with gravity** (vertical orientation).

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **periodic torso motion** (e.g., walking or bending) with:  
- Forward acceleration bursts (x-axis accelerometer).  
- Vertical oscillations (y/z-axis accelerometer).  
- Pitch-dominated rotations (y-axis gyroscope).  
- Stable heading (magnetometer).  

This aligns with activities like **brisk walking** or **light exercise** involving repetitive torso movements. The absence of sharp yaw or roll variations suggests a straightforward, non-twisting motion pattern."
43,1498121643330,1498121653320,Still,Walking,"<<Walking>>  
**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Evidence**:  
   - **y-axis (Vertical)**: The dominant acceleration (~8 m/s²) aligns with gravity but shows periodic dips (e.g., 7.84 m/s² at sample 29). These dips correlate with the torso’s vertical motion during walking steps, where the body slightly lowers (stance phase) and rises (swing phase).  
   - **x/z-axes**: Minimal forward/lateral acceleration (ranges: 4.7–5.1 m/s² and 2.2–3.0 m/s²). Small spikes (e.g., x-axis: 5.13 m/s² at sample 8) suggest gentle torso sway, not vigorous motion like running or car movement.  

2. **Gyroscope Evidence**:  
   - **y-axis (Pitch)**: Sustained negative values (samples 5–10: -0.14 to -0.08 rad/s) indicate rhythmic forward/backward torso tilting, characteristic of walking gait phases.  
   - **x/z-axes**: Low-magnitude oscillations (<0.1 rad/s) rule out intense rotations (e.g., car turns) or erratic movements (e.g., running).  

3. **Magnetometer Context**:  
   - Gradual variations (e.g., x-axis decline from -12.9 to -15.3 µT) reflect torso reorientation during walking, not static postures (Still) or vehicle motion (Car). Environmental noise is present but unrelated to activity classification.  

4. **Activity Elimination**:  
   - **Still**: Requires stable accelerometer/gyroscope baselines. Observed periodic y-axis accelerometer dips and gyroscope pitch oscillations contradict this.  
   - **Run**: Higher accelerometer magnitudes (>10 m/s²) and gyroscope peaks (>1 rad/s) expected. Data shows lower ranges (accel: <5.1 m/s², gyro: <0.15 rad/s).  
   - **Car**: Distinctive lateral/forward accelerometer spikes (e.g., braking/turning) or sustained gyroscope yaw (steering). Absent here.  

**Conclusion**: The periodic vertical acceleration, rhythmic pitch oscillations, and low-intensity motion align with **Walking**.","The IMU data collected over 10 seconds (100 samples per sensor) exhibits the following characteristics:

- **y-axis**:  
  - **Range**: 7.8–8.2 m/s² (highest magnitude)  
  - **Trend**: Dominant vertical acceleration, likely gravity-aligned. Variability (e.g., dip to 7.84 m/s² at sample 29) implies periodic torso elevation changes (e.g., walking steps).  
- **z-axis**:  
  - **Range**: 2.2–3.0 m/s²  
  - **Trend**: Irregular fluctuations (mean ~2.5–2.7). Peaks (e.g., 2.96 m/s² at sample 63) hint at lateral shifts or posture adjustments.  

**Summary**: Vertical (y-axis) acceleration dominates, consistent with torso motion during walking. Minimal lateral/forward activity.

  - **Range**: -0.09 to 0.09 rad/s  
  - **Trend**: Near-zero mean with alternating polarity. Brief negative spikes (e.g., -0.123 rad/s at sample 14) suggest minor torso roll adjustments.  
- **y-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -0.14 to 0.10 rad/s  
  - **Trend**: Largest variability. Sustained negative values (samples 5–10: -0.14 to -0.08 rad/s) indicate torso pitch (leaning forward/backward).  
- **z-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -0.05 to 0.08 rad/s  
  - **Trend**: Small oscillations (mean ~0). Spikes (e.g., 0.076 rad/s at sample 94) imply occasional yaw rotations (torso turning).  

**Summary**: Low-intensity rotational motion. Dominant pitch (y-axis) variations align with walking dynamics.

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**
- **x-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -15.3 to -11.2 µT  
  - **Trend**: Gradual decline (e.g., -12.9 to -15.3 µT), likely due to device reorientation relative to Earth’s magnetic field.  
- **y-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -24.2 to -20.6 µT  
  - **Trend**: High variability (e.g., -21.9 to -23.6 µT at samples 50–60), suggesting torso rotation affecting magnetic alignment.  
- **z-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -35.1 to -32.0 µT  
  - **Trend**: Stable negative baseline with minor dips (e.g., -34.9 µT at sample 63), reflecting minimal vertical magnetic interference.  

**Summary**: Environmental magnetic field dominates. Variations align with torso orientation changes during motion.

### **Key Inferences**
1. **Activity Type**: Likely **walking** or light ambulation:  
   - Periodic vertical acceleration (y-axis accelerometer).  
   - Rhythmic pitch oscillations (y-axis gyroscope).  
   - Low rotational energy (gyroscope magnitudes < 0.15 rad/s).  

2. **Motion Dynamics**:  
   - Torso remains mostly upright (stable y-axis accelerometer ~8 m/s² near gravity).  
   - Subtle lateral (z-axis accelerometer) and rotational (yaw/pitch) adjustments.  

3. **Sensor Noise**:  
   - Magnetometer noise likely due to environmental interference (e.g., indoor metal objects).  
   - Gyroscope drift minimal but present (baseline fluctuations near zero).

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Dynamics**:  
   - A **sharp X-axis spike** (5.8 m/s² at ~5.8 sec) indicates **sudden frontal acceleration**, typical of a vehicle braking/accelerating. Gravity-aligned torso motion in a car (e.g., sudden stop/start) explains the spike and subsequent stabilization.  
   - **Y-axis variations** (7.5–9.16 m/s²) align with lateral sway from steering or road vibrations.  
   - **Z-axis baseline (~2.4–3.0 m/s²)** suggests sensor tilt (common in seated car postures), not vertical motion from walking/running.  

2. **Gyroscope Correlations**:  
   - **Pitch rotation peak** (+0.48 rad/s) at 5.8 sec matches the accelerometer spike, reflecting torso inertia during abrupt vehicle motion.  
   - **Roll variations** (-0.42 to +0.39 rad/s) correlate with lateral sway (e.g., turns or lane changes).  
   - **Negligible yaw** rules out walking/running (which involve rhythmic heading changes).  

3. **Magnetometer Stability**:  
   - Noisy but stable trends suggest minimal reorientation (consistent with seated posture in a car).  

4. **Activity Elimination**:  
   - **Still**: Excluded due to dynamic mid-recording spikes.  
   - **Walking/Run**: Require periodic gait cycles (absent here; single event dominates).  
   - **Car**: Matches isolated acceleration/deceleration event, lateral adjustments, and stable post-spike recovery.  

**Conclusion**: The abrupt forward acceleration, lateral compensation, and sensor tilt align with **vehicle motion** (e.g., hard braking or acceleration), not ambulation or static postures.","### Analysis of IMU Sensor Data Trends and Distributions  
The IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) collected from the torso over 10 seconds (100 samples at 10Hz) reveals distinct trends and variations. Below is a breakdown of key observations:

2. **Y-axis**: Ranges from **-24.6 µT** to **-19.8 µT**.  
3. **Z-axis**: Varies between **-35.4 µT** and **-31.9 µT**.  

**Summary**:  
- **Noisy but stable trends**, typical for indoor environments with magnetic interference.  
- Sharp dips (e.g., X-axis at **-14.5 µT**) may correlate with device reorientation during motion.  

---

### **Activity Inference**  
1. **Primary Movement**:  
   - A **sudden forward-leaning motion** (accelerometer X-axis spike + gyroscope pitch peak) at ~5.8 seconds.  
   - Likely accompanied by **lateral compensation** (gyroscope roll variations).  

2. **Posture Recovery**:  
   - Stabilization in accelerometer/gyroscope data after ~6 seconds suggests return to equilibrium.  

3. **Possible Activities**:  
   - **Bending to pick up an object**, **stumbling/recovery**, or **controlled exercise** (e.g., forward lunges).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **dynamic torso motion** with a pronounced forward-leaning event, lateral adjustments, and stabilization. The gyroscope and accelerometer trends strongly correlate, while magnetometer data remains stable despite noise. This aligns with activities requiring abrupt torso movements followed by posture correction."

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **Vertical (y-axis):** Sustained values near ~8.1–8.4 m/s² (close to gravity) confirm an upright torso. Minor fluctuations (e.g., 8.1 → 8.0 drop) suggest **rhythmic vertical shifts** during steps, not abrupt posture changes.  
- **Horizontal (x/z-axes):**  
  - **x-axis**: Stable baseline (~4.0–4.4 m/s²) with oscillations typical of **forward-backward torso sway** during walking.  
  - **z-axis**: Spike at sample 50 (~3.2 m/s²) aligns with lateral weight shifts (e.g., stepping sideways).  
- **Conclusion**: Rhythmic horizontal accelerations match **walking cadence**, excluding ""Still"" or ""Car"" (no engine vibrations).  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **y-axis**: Largest rotational spikes (e.g., 0.248 rad/s at sample 80) indicate **torso rotation during turns**, consistent with walking direction changes.  
- **x/z-axes**: Minimal tilt/yaw activity (< ±0.05 rad/s), ruling out erratic motions (e.g., ""Run"" or ""Car"" maneuvers).  
- **Key Event**: Spike at ~8 seconds correlates with magnetometer deviations, confirming a **controlled turn** (not vehicle motion).  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Correlation**  
- **x-axis dip** (−8.25 μT at sample 70) coincides with gyroscope y-axis spike, reinforcing a **directional turn** during walking.  
- **Environmental stability**: y-axis (−19 to −21 μT) aligns with Earth’s field, ruling out vehicle-induced magnetic interference.  

---

### **Activity Elimination**  
- **Still**: Excluded due to rhythmic accelerometer oscillations and rotational spikes.  
- **Run**: No high-frequency/jerk accelerations (x/z axes < 4.4 m/s²) or sustained gyroscope activity.  
- **Car**: Absence of engine vibrations (smooth accelerometer baseline) and directional consistency in magnetometer.  

---

### **Final Classification**  
The combination of **gravity-aligned posture**, **rhythmic horizontal accelerations**, and **isolated torso rotations** aligns with **Walking** (likely slow-paced with occasional turns). Magnetometer noise and gyroscope spikes reflect natural human motion, not vehicular or static scenarios.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s)  
The data reflects **low-to-moderate physical activity** with stable posture and occasional rotational movements. Below is a breakdown of key trends:

---

#### **1. Accelerometer Trends**  
- **Vertical Axis (Likely y-axis):**  
  - Sustained high values (~8–8.4 m/s²), consistent with **gravity dominance** (torso upright). Minor fluctuations suggest slight postural adjustments (e.g., breathing, slow walking).  
  - Sharp drop in later samples (y: 8.1 → 8.0) may indicate a brief pause or balance correction.  

- **Horizontal Axes (x and z):**  
  - **x-axis**: Stable baseline (~4.0–4.4 m/s²) with minor oscillations, typical of forward/backward torso sway during walking.  
  - **z-axis**: Lower range (~2.7–3.2 m/s²), reflecting lateral stability. A spike near 3.2 m/s² (sample 50) suggests a lateral shift or step.  

- **Key Insight**: Data aligns with **steady-state activity** (e.g., walking or standing with subtle movements). No abrupt jolts or falls detected.

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Trends**  
- **Rotational Dynamics**:  
  - **x-axis**: Near-zero mean with minor spikes (e.g., −0.134 rad/s at sample 70), likely torso tilts or shoulder adjustments.  
  - **y-axis**: Largest variations (e.g., 0.248 rad/s at sample 80), suggesting **torso rotation** (e.g., turning or twisting).  
  - **z-axis**: Minimal activity (most values < ±0.02 rad/s), indicating limited yaw motion (consistent with forward-facing movement).  

- **Spike Analysis**:  
  - A notable y-axis spike (0.248 rad/s) at ~8 seconds correlates with magnetometer deviations, hinting at a **directional turn** or posture shift.  

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **Environmental Stability**:  
  - **y-axis**: Strong negative field (~−19 to −21 μT), aligning with Earth’s magnetic field orientation.  
  - **x/z-axes**: Moderate fluctuations (x: −8.25 to −3.87 μT; z: −35.8 to −33.1 μT), likely due to device reorientation or environmental interference.  

- **Anomaly**:  
  - Sharp **x-axis dip** (−8.25 μT at sample 70) coincides with gyroscope y-axis spike, reinforcing a **rotational event** (e.g., turning the torso).  

---

#### **Activity Inference**  
- **Most Likely Scenario**: **Slow walking or standing with occasional turns**.  
  - Accelerometer: Steady gravity-aligned signal with rhythmic horizontal variations.  
  - Gyroscope: Intermittent torso rotations (y-axis spikes).  
  - Magnetometer: Directional shifts consistent with turns.  

- **Unlikely Activities**: Running, jumping, or high-intensity motions (no extreme accelerations/rotations).  

---

#### **Key Observations**  
1. **Postural Stability**: Gravity dominates accelerometer y-axis, confirming upright torso.  
2. **Controlled Motion**: Gyroscope spikes are isolated, suggesting deliberate turns rather than erratic movement.  
3. **Environmental Noise**: Magnetometer deviations may reflect indoor magnetic interference (e.g., metal objects).  

This analysis aligns with **routine daily movements** (e.g., walking, turning) rather than strenuous exercise. For precise classification, fusion algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter) would refine orientation estimates and reduce magnetometer noise."
46,1498121673330,1498121683320,Still,Walking,"<<Walking>>  
**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Patterns:**  
   - **y-axis (vertical):** Dominates with values ~8.1–8.7 m/s², slightly below gravity (9.8 m/s²), indicating the sensor is tilted forward/backward. The gradual decline (8.7 → 8.1 m/s²) and peak at sample 80 align with rhythmic vertical motion during walking (e.g., heel strikes and torso tilting).  
   - **z-axis (forward/backward):** Sharp periodic spikes (e.g., 3.27 m/s² at sample 34) correlate with step-induced forward torso motion. The oscillations (2.58–3.27 m/s²) match stride dynamics.  
   - **x-axis (lateral):** Minimal variability (~3.95–4.26 m/s²) confirms stable torso alignment, ruling out erratic motions like running or car movement.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics:**  
   - **y-axis (pitch):** Bipolar fluctuations (-0.08 to 0.12 rad/s) reflect rhythmic forward/backward tilting during steps, characteristic of walking.  
   - **x/z-axes:** Near-zero activity (-0.10–0.12 rad/s roll, -0.05–0.05 rad/s yaw) excludes significant rotational motion (e.g., car turns) or high-intensity leg swings (running).  

3. **Magnetometer Noise:** Environmental interference (-36.05 to -3.25 µT) complicates orientation tracking but does not contradict walking, as magnetic fields are less critical for gait detection.  

4. **Exclusion of Other Activities:**  
   - **Still:** Requires minimal accelerometer/gyroscope variance; inconsistent with observed periodic spikes.  
   - **Run:** Higher acceleration magnitudes (>15 m/s² in running) and gyroscope intensity (pitch >0.5 rad/s) absent.  
   - **Car:** Smooth lateral/rotational gyroscope trends (e.g., turns) or vibrations not observed; torso dynamics align with human gait.  

**Conclusion:** Rhythmic y-axis accelerometer spikes, pitch gyroscope fluctuations, and controlled torso motion confirm **Walking**.","The IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) collected from a torso-mounted smartphone over 10 seconds (10Hz sampling) reveals the following patterns:

- **y-axis (vertical/anteroposterior motion):**  
  - **Range:** 8.11–8.70 m/s²  
  - **Trend:** Dominates sensor magnitude, reflecting gravity (~9.8 m/s² not fully aligned with the axis) and activity. Gradual decline (8.7 → 8.1 m/s²) suggests forward/backward tilting or posture adjustments.  
  - **Key Feature:** Peak at sample 80 (8.70 m/s²) implies a sudden upward motion (e.g., torso straightening).

- **z-axis (forward/backward motion):**  
  - **Range:** 2.58–3.27 m/s²  
  - **Trend:** Oscillates with sharper spikes (e.g., 3.27 m/s² at sample 34), likely from periodic torso rotations or steps during walking.  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Trends**

- **y-axis (pitch):**  
  - **Range:** -0.08 to 0.12 rad/s  
  - **Trend:** Bipolar fluctuations (negative to positive), suggesting rhythmic forward/backward tilting (e.g., walking or bending).  

- **z-axis (yaw):**  
  - **Range:** -0.05 to 0.05 rad/s  
  - **Trend:** Minimal rotation, with a slight drift toward positive values (subtle turning motion).  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**
- **x-axis:**  
  - **Range:** -6.81 to -3.25 µT  
  - **Trend:** Gradual decline (-6.8 → -4.0 µT), likely due to orientation changes relative to Earth’s magnetic field.  

- **y-axis:**  
  - **Range:** -21.44 to -18.91 µT  
  - **Trend:** Stable with minor dips (e.g., -18.91 µT at sample 55), aligning with torso rotations.  

- **z-axis:**  
  - **Range:** -36.05 to -33.25 µT  
  - **Trend:** Noisy but consistent, reflecting environmental magnetic interference.  

---

### **Activity Inference**
- **Dominant Motion:** Vertical acceleration (y-axis) and forward/backward rotation (gyroscope y-axis) suggest **walking or light jogging**.  
- **Torso Dynamics:** Minimal lateral/rotational motion (stable x/z accelerometer, low gyroscope activity) implies upright, controlled movement.  
- **Magnetometer Noise:** Environmental interference (e.g., indoor magnetic fields) complicates orientation analysis.  

---

### **Summary**
- **Accelerometer:** Vertical (y-axis) motion dominates, with periodic forward/backward spikes (z-axis).  
- **Gyroscope:** Low-intensity tilting (pitch) and minor rotational adjustments.  
- **Magnetometer:** Orientation changes and environmental noise.  
- **Likely Activity:** Steady walking with posture adjustments, consistent with torso-mounted sensor dynamics."

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:  
1. **Accelerometer Y-axis Dominance**:  
   - The Y-axis (forward/backward) accelerometer data has a **mean of ~8.3 m/s²** with oscillations (±0.5 m/s²). This is higher than gravity (9.8 m/s² projected on tilted axes), indicating **dynamic forward motion**.  
   - **Pattern**: Oscillations align with **step-induced torso movements** (e.g., leaning forward during strides). The range (~7.9–8.5 m/s²) and variance are consistent with walking, not running (which would show larger, faster fluctuations).  

2. **Z-axis Tilt and Stability**:  
   - The Z-axis accelerometer (~2.8–3.0 m/s²) confirms the device is **tilted horizontally** (e.g., placed on the chest). Gravity is partially projected onto the Y-axis, amplifying its baseline.  
   - Minor vertical oscillations (~0.3 m/s²) suggest **light vertical torso motion** (e.g., slight up/down movement during steps), not vigorous enough for running.  

3. **Gyroscope Y-axis Activity**:  
   - The Y-axis gyroscope shows **intermittent peaks up to ±0.32 rad/s**, correlating with **torso rotation during leg swings**. These spikes are rhythmic but not sustained, matching walking cadence.  
   - Running would generate **higher-magnitude, more frequent rotations** (e.g., >0.5 rad/s), while ""Still"" or ""Car"" would lack such periodic spikes.  

4. **Lack of Lateral/Vertical Dynamics**:  
   - X/Z accelerometer axes are stable (~4.0–4.5 m/s² and ~2.6–3.1 m/s², respectively), with no sharp peaks. This rules out lateral shuffling (X-axis) or jumping (Z-axis).  
   - Gyroscope X/Z axes show minimal variance, excluding activities like twisting (e.g., turning in a car) or erratic motion.  

5. **Magnetometer Context**:  
   - Y-axis magnetometer values are strongest (aligned with Earth’s field), supporting the device’s horizontal placement. Variations reflect minor orientation changes during walking but no large heading shifts (e.g., car turns).  

**Conclusion**: The combination of **rhythmic Y-axis accelerometer oscillations**, **moderate torso rotations (gyroscope Y-axis)**, and **stable lateral/vertical axes** strongly indicates **walking**. The data lacks the intensity/frequency of running, randomness of car motion, or flatline stability of ""Still.""","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Trends and Distributions:

- **Y-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -0.21 to +0.32 rad/s  
  - **Trend**: Largest variance with intermittent spikes (e.g., +0.32 rad/s at sample 11). Indicates significant rotational motion (e.g., torso turning or bending forward/backward).  

- **Z-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -0.05 to +0.07 rad/s  
  - **Trend**: Near-zero baseline with small oscillations, suggesting minimal yaw rotation.

- **X-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -8.12 to -4.25 µT  
  - **Trend**: Gradual shifts (e.g., -6.76 to -4.25 µT) likely due to orientation changes.  

- **Y-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -22.19 to -19.56 µT  
  - **Trend**: Consistently high magnitude (strongest axis), with periodic dips (e.g., -22.19 µT). Aligns with Earth’s magnetic field horizontal component.  

- **Z-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -35.18 to -31.93 µT  
  - **Trend**: Stable negative values (vertical field component), with minor fluctuations from torso movement.  

---

### **Key Observations**:
1. **Dominant Motion**:  
   - **Y-axis acceleration** (8.3 m/s² mean) and **y-axis gyroscope** (peaks at ±0.3 rad/s) suggest **forward/backward torso motion** (e.g., walking, leaning).  
   - **Z-axis acceleration** (~2.8–3.0 m/s²) confirms device tilt (e.g., phone placed horizontally on chest).  

2. **Activity Inference**:  
   - Likely **walking** or **light jogging**:  
     - Y-axis acceleration oscillations align with step-induced torso motion.  
     - Y-axis gyroscope spikes correlate with leg swings or turns.  
   - Minimal lateral (X-axis) or rotational (Z-axis) movements.  

3. **Magnetometer Noise**:  
   - Variations likely reflect orientation changes rather than motion, but environmental interference (indoors) limits utility for precise heading estimation.  

---

### **Trend Distributions**:
- **Accelerometer**:  
  - Y-axis: High-magnitude, low-variance (sustained motion).  
  - X/Z-axes: Low-magnitude, stable (minimal lateral/vertical dynamics).  
- **Gyroscope**:  
  - Y-axis: High variance (rotational activity).  
  - X/Z-axes: Low variance (restricted motion).

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Dynamics**:  
   - The x-axis spike (~5.5 m/s² at 5 seconds) suggests a **brief forward/backward torso motion** (e.g., bending or recovering balance), but the overall signal lacks periodicity. Walking/Running would show rhythmic oscillations, while Car motion would involve sustained directional changes.  
   - The y-axis stabilizes near **8.3–8.5 m/s²** (gravity-aligned for upright posture), with minor lateral shifts (leaning, not walking).  
   - The z-axis fluctuates between **2.2–3.7 m/s²**, reflecting vertical adjustments (e.g., standing/crouching), not repetitive steps.  

2. **Gyroscope Activity**:  
   - Rotational spikes (y-axis: **-0.48 rad/s**, z-axis: **-0.30 rad/s**) indicate **sudden torso twists/tilts**, likely balancing or reorienting. These are transient, not cyclical (ruling out Walking/Running).  
   - The absence of sustained angular velocity (e.g., turning in a car) supports a stationary context with corrective motions.  

3. **Magnetometer Reorientation**:  
   - The x-axis decline (**-5 µT → -17 µT**) signifies a **torso rotation** (e.g., facing northward). However, this aligns with balance recovery (e.g., turning to stabilize), not vehicular motion.  

4. **Event Synthesis**:  
   - The dominant **5-second x-axis spike** (accelerometer) coincides with rotational gyroscope activity and magnetometer reorientation, pointing to a **single balance-correcting maneuver** (e.g., tripping, then stabilizing).  
   - No periodic gait patterns (Walking/Running) or prolonged acceleration/steering (Car) are observed.  

**Conclusion**: The data reflects a **stationary posture interrupted by a brief balance-recovery motion**, consistent with **Still**.","### Analysis Summary of IMU Data Trends

#### **1. Accelerometer Data**  
**Main Elements & Trends**:  
- **X-axis**:  
  - Starts near **4.0 m/s²**, stabilizes, then sharply rises to **~5.5 m/s²** (samples 20–50, **2–5 seconds**).

- **Y-axis**:  
  - Stable around **8.3–8.5 m/s²** initially, dips to **7.5 m/s²** (samples 30–50), then rebounds to **~8.5 m/s²**. Suggests lateral shifts (e.g., leaning sideways).  
- **Z-axis**:  
  - Declines from **~3.0 m/s²** to **2.2 m/s²** (samples 15–25), then rises to **3.7 m/s²** (samples 60–80). Indicates vertical motion (e.g., crouching or standing).  

**Key Event**: A **sudden forward/backward acceleration** (x-axis spike at 5 seconds) dominates the dataset, likely linked to a torso movement like bending or recovering balance.  

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Data**  
**Main Elements & Trends**:  
- **X-axis**:  
  - Near-zero initially, spikes to **0.19 rad/s** (sample 15), then oscillates between **-0.16 rad/s** and **0.14 rad/s**. Suggests rotational motion (e.g., torso twisting).  
- **Y-axis**:  
  - Starts positive (**0.08 rad/s**), drops to **-0.48 rad/s** (sample 70), then recovers. Indicates sideways tilting (e.g., loss of balance).  
- **Z-axis**:  
  - Peaks at **0.26 rad/s** (sample 25), then trends negative (**-0.30 rad/s** at sample 70). Likely turning/twisting (e.g., pivoting).  

**Key Event**: **Sharp rotational activity** at **1.5–7 seconds** (y-axis and z-axis), potentially correlating with the accelerometer’s x-axis spike.  

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Data**  
**Main Elements & Trends**:  
- **X-axis**:  
  - Gradual decline from **-5 µT** to **-17 µT** (samples 30–50), reflecting significant orientation change (e.g., torso turning northward).  
- **Y-axis**:  
  - Stable around **-20 µT**, with minor dips (e.g., **-17 µT** at sample 60). Minimal lateral reorientation.  
- **Z-axis**:  
  - Consistently negative (**-34 µT**), dips to **-36 µT** (samples 60–80). Suggests vertical alignment shifts.  

**Key Event**: **Strong reorientation** (x-axis dip at 5 seconds), aligning with accelerometer/gyroscope spikes.  

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**  
The data suggests a **compound motion sequence**:  
1. **Initial rotation** (gyroscope x/y-axis spikes) at **1.5–2 seconds**.  
2. **Forward/backward acceleration** (x-axis accelerometer spike) at **5 seconds**, possibly bending or stumbling.  
3. **Torso reorientation** (magnetometer x-axis shift) at **5–7 seconds**, e.g., recovering balance or turning.  

**Likely Activities**: A **balance-recovery maneuver** (e.g., tripping and stabilizing) or a **dynamic movement** like bending to pick up an object followed by a turn.  

---

### **Trend Distributions**  
- **Accelerometer**: Non-periodic, event-driven (single dominant spike).  
- **Gyroscope**: Semi-periodic rotational fluctuations.  
- **Magnetometer**: Steady decline (x-axis) with minor noise, indicating sustained reorientation.  

This analysis aligns with **torso-mounted IMU data** capturing abrupt, multi-axis motions typical of daily activities or balance challenges."
49,1498121703330,1498121713320,Still,Walking,"<<Walking>>  
**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Evidence**  
- **Y-axis Dominance (8.0–8.5 m/s²):**  
  The sustained high Y-axis values align with gravity’s vertical component (≈9.8 m/s²) slightly reduced due to torso-mounted placement. Minor fluctuations (e.g., ~8.1–8.5 m/s²) indicate rhythmic vertical oscillations consistent with **walking** (step-induced torso motion). A running gait would show larger, faster oscillations (>9 m/s²), while ""Still"" or ""Car"" would lack such periodic vertical activity.  
  - Example: Stable Y-axis baseline with subtle dips (e.g., sample 32: 8.22 m/s² → 8.12 m/s²) matches heel-strike and lift phases of walking.  

- **Z-axis Decline (3.3 → 1.98 m/s²):**  
  The gradual drop in Z-axis acceleration (torso-forward axis) suggests a **forward lean** or bending motion, particularly in later samples. A sharp decline (e.g., sample 59: 2.65 → 1.98 m/s²) aligns with a posture shift, likely concluding the activity with a bend.  

- **X-axis Spike (5.07 m/s² at sample 59):**  
  A sudden forward/backward acceleration spike (e.g., abrupt stop or posture adjustment) supports a transition from walking to bending.  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Evidence**  
- **Low Magnitudes (±0.3 rad/s max):**  
  Subtle rotational velocities (Y-axis: ±0.3 rad/s, X/Z: ±0.2 rad/s) rule out ""Run"" (higher angular motion) or ""Car"" (sharp turns). Y-axis spikes (e.g., -0.32 rad/s at sample 83) correlate with lateral balance adjustments during walking.  

- **Z-axis Stability (~0 rad/s):**  
  Minimal yaw rotation confirms forward-facing movement without turns (discards ""Car"" or complex maneuvers).  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **Z-axis Stability (-31.1 to -34.8 μT):**  
  Strong, stable Z-axis magnetic field (aligned with Earth’s vertical component) supports upright posture initially, with late dips (-31.06 μT) matching the forward lean inferred from accelerometer Z-axis.  

- **X/Y-axis Noise:**  
  Fluctuations (-12.2 to -21.2 μT) suggest indoor magnetic interference or minor device reorientation during walking, not indicative of vehicular motion.  

---

### **Synthesis**  
- **Walking Phase:**  
  Dominant Y-axis accelerometer oscillations, low gyroscope activity, and stable magnetometer Z-axis confirm steady walking. The X-axis accelerometer’s periodic dips (e.g., sample 36–40: ~3.94 m/s²) align with stride-induced forward/backward torso motion.  

- **Forward Bend:**  
  Declining Z-axis acceleration (posture shift) and late Y-axis magnetometer decline (orientation change) suggest bending forward. The X-axis spike (sample 59) likely marks the abrupt halt before bending.  

- **Rejected Hypotheses:**  
  - **Still:** Requires flat accelerometer trends across all axes.  
  - **Run:** Higher Y-axis accelerometer peaks (>9 m/s²) and gyroscope magnitudes expected.  
  - **Car:** Lack of sustained lateral acceleration (e.g., turns) or high-frequency vibrations.  

**Conclusion:** The data reflects **walking** with a concluding **forward bend**, consistent with torso-mounted sensor dynamics.","The IMU data (10Hz, 10s) from a torso-mounted smartphone shows the following key characteristics:

### **1. Accelerometer Trends**
- **X-axis**: 
  - Baseline ≈4.3–4.5 m/s² with periodic dips (e.g., ~3.94 m/s² at sample 36–40). 
  - Ends with a spike (5.07 m/s² at sample 59), suggesting abrupt forward/backward motion.
- **Y-axis**: 
  - Dominant axis (8.0–8.5 m/s²), likely aligned with gravity + vertical torso motion. 
  - Stable with minor fluctuations, indicating upright posture with subtle vertical oscillations (e.g., walking or breathing).
- **Z-axis**: 
  - Declining trend from ~3.3 m/s² to ~1.98 m/s². 
  - Sharp drop in later samples suggests a posture change (e.g., leaning forward or bending).

---

### **2. Gyroscope Trends**
- **X-axis**: 
  - Near-zero mean with minor oscillations (±0.2 rad/s). 
  - Slight negative bias early, transitioning to positive later (possible torso rotation initiation).
- **Y-axis**: 
  - Largest variability (±0.3 rad/s). 
  - Negative spikes (e.g., -0.25 rad/s at sample 32, -0.32 rad/s at sample 83) hint at lateral tilting or balance adjustments.
- **Z-axis**: 
  - Stable around zero (±0.1 rad/s). 
  - Minimal yaw rotation, indicating forward-facing movement.

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**
- **X-axis**: 
  - Fluctuates between -12.2 and -17.4 μT (environmental interference or device rotation).
- **Y-axis**: 
  - Ranges from -16.4 to -21.2 μT, with a gradual decline (consistent with directional changes).
- **Z-axis**: 
  - Strongest field (-31.1 to -34.8 μT), stable except for late dips (-31.06 μT), likely due to orientation shifts.

---

### **Key Observations**
1. **Movement Type**: 
   - Y-axis accelerometer dominance suggests vertical motion (e.g., walking/jogging). 
   - Declining z-axis acceleration and y-axis magnetometer imply a forward lean or bending action.
   
2. **Rotational Activity**: 
   - Low gyroscope magnitudes indicate subtle torso adjustments rather than sharp turns.

3. **Environmental Factors**: 
   - Magnetometer noise (x/y-axis) likely reflects indoor magnetic interference or device reorientation.

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**
The data aligns with **walking followed by a forward bend** (evident from z-axis acceleration drop and y-axis magnetometer trend). Minimal rotation (gyroscope) and vertical oscillation (y-axis accelerometer) support steady gait before posture change."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Clues**:  
   - **Gravity Alignment**: The y-axis consistently measures ~8.1–8.5 m/s², aligning with gravity, indicating an upright torso posture.  
   - **Dynamic Axes**:  
     - **x-axis**: Moderate fluctuations (4.15–4.6 m/s²) with periodic dips (e.g., sample 33: 4.15 m/s²), matching torso sway during steps.  
     - **z-axis**: Gradual upward drift (2.0–3.0 m/s²) suggests subtle vertical motion from step-induced torso elevation.  
   - **No High-Frequency Peaks**: Absence of rapid acceleration spikes (e.g., >10 m/s²) rules out **running** or abrupt motions like **Car** maneuvers.  

2. **Gyroscope Patterns**:  
   - **Low Rotational Rates**:  
     - **y-axis**: Slight sagittal-plane fluctuations (~0.1 rad/s) correlate with forward leg motion during walking.  
     - **x/z-axes**: Near-zero values (except sparse minor spikes) exclude significant lateral tilts or turns.  
   - **Noise Profile**: High-frequency noise aligns with low-intensity movement (e.g., arm swing), inconsistent with **Still** (minimal noise) or **Car** (smooth rotations).  

3. **Magnetometer Stability**:  
   - **Stable Heading**: No abrupt changes in magnetic field (x: -13.75–-18.25 µT, y: -16.0–-20.0 µT), suggesting straight-line motion without turns (eliminating **Car** with potential directional shifts).  
   - **Environment Consistency**: Earth’s magnetic field dominance (z: -30.0–-34.7 µT) implies minimal interference, typical for walking outdoors.  

4. **Sampling Rate Consideration**:  
   - **10Hz Limitation**: Captures step-related torso oscillations (~1–2 Hz for walking) but would alias higher-frequency motions (e.g., running strides >3 Hz). The absence of aliasing artifacts supports **walking**.  

5. **Activity Differentiation**:  
   - **Still**: Excluded due to x/z acceleration variations and gyroscope noise.  
   - **Run**: Requires higher acceleration magnitudes (>10 m/s²) and gyroscope peaks (>1 rad/s), absent here.  
   - **Car**: Typically shows smoother acceleration trends (e.g., braking/acceleration) and magnetometer heading changes, neither observed.  

**Conclusion**: The data reflects **walking**—periodic torso sway, low rotational rates, stable orientation, and environment—consistent with steady, low-intensity locomotion.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis  
The IMU data (10Hz, 10 seconds) from a torso-mounted smartphone reveals the following trends and key elements:  

---

#### **1. Accelerometer Trends**  
- **Gravity-Aligned Axis**:  
  - The **y-axis** shows the highest magnitude (8.1–8.5 m/s²), likely aligned with gravity (typical torso orientation).  
  - **Stability**: Minimal high-frequency fluctuations, suggesting steady posture (e.g., standing or slow walking).  
- **Dynamic Axes (x and z)**:  
  - **x-axis**: Moderate variations (4.15–4.6 m/s²) with slight dips (e.g., sample 33: 4.15) and recovery, possibly due to torso sway or steps.  
  - **z-axis**: Gradual upward drift (2.0–3.0 m/s²), indicating vertical motion (e.g., subtle torso elevation or tilt).  

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Trends**  
- **Low Rotational Activity**:  
  - **x-axis**: Sparse spikes (e.g., -0.177 rad/s at sample 17) but mostly near-zero values, suggesting minor lateral tilts.  
  - **y-axis**: Slightly higher fluctuations (e.g., 0.1 rad/s at sample 37), hinting at sagittal-plane motion (e.g., forward steps).  
  - **z-axis**: Minimal rotation, ruling out significant turning.  
- **Noise**: High-frequency noise across axes, typical for low-intensity movements.  

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **Stable Field Orientation**:  
  - **x-axis**: -13.75 to -18.25 µT (local magnetic interference).  
  - **y-axis**: -16.0 to -20.0 µT (aligned with Earth’s horizontal field).  
  - **z-axis**: -30.0 to -34.7 µT (Earth’s vertical component dominance).  
- **No Sharp Changes**: No abrupt shifts in heading, suggesting minimal directional changes (e.g., straight walking).  

---

### **Activity Inference**  
- **Primary Motion**: Likely **walking or light ambulation** with:  
  - **Periodic x/z-acceleration variations** (step-related torso oscillations).  
  - **Low rotational rates** (arm swing or hip motion).  
- **Posture**: Upright, with y-axis gravity alignment.  
- **Environment**: Stable magnetic field (indoor/outdoor with minimal metal interference).  

---

### **Key Observations**  
- **Low Sampling Limitation**: 10Hz may undersample high-frequency motions (e.g., running).  
- **No Anomalies**: No extreme spikes (e.g., falls or jumps).  
- **Sensor Fusion**: Gravity (y-axis) and magnetic stability suggest fusion algorithms could reliably estimate orientation.  

This data aligns with **low-intensity, steady locomotion** (e.g., walking) in a stable magnetic environment."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **Gravity Alignment**: The y-axis accelerometer consistently reads **8.0–8.7 m/s²**, aligning with gravity, confirming the device is upright on the torso.  
- **Rhythmic Perturbations**:  
  - **x-axis**: Dips to **~3.9 m/s²** (samples 50–55, 80–90) correlate with forward/backward torso motion during steps. Recovery to baseline after each dip matches the cyclical nature of walking.  
  - **z-axis**: Variability (2.5–3.3 m/s²) and spikes (e.g., ~3.3 m/s² at sample 60) suggest lateral weight shifts during strides.  
- **Magnitude**: Accelerations are moderate (~4–8 m/s²), inconsistent with the higher forces of **running** (typically >10 m/s²) or the static baseline of **Still**.  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **Pitch Oscillations (y-axis)**: Alternating peaks (~±0.19 rad/s) indicate rhythmic forward/backward torso tilts, characteristic of walking strides.  
- **Transient Spikes**:  
  - **x-axis**: A large spike (0.52 rad/s at sample 80) suggests a brief torso roll (e.g., adjusting balance or sidestepping).  
  - **z-axis**: A minor yaw spike (0.13 rad/s at sample 60) aligns with slight heading changes during walking.  
- **Baseline Stability**: Near-zero baselines (x/z-axes) rule out sustained rotational motion (e.g., **Car** turns).  

---

### **3. Activity Differentiation**  
- **Walking vs. Running**:  
  - **Frequency**: Accelerometer dips occur every ~30–40 samples (3–4 Hz), matching a walking cadence (~2–4 steps/second). Running would show higher-frequency perturbations (>5 Hz).  
  - **Amplitude**: Accelerometer dips (~0.5 m/s²) and gyroscope peaks (~0.2 rad/s) are too low for running.  
- **Still**: Stable gravity alignment (y-axis) but lacks rhythmic perturbations.  
- **Car**: Magnetometer x/y-axis shifts suggest lateral motion, but the periodic accelerometer/gyroscope patterns are inconsistent with vehicular vibration (irregular, lower amplitude).  

---

### **4. Magnetometer Context**  
- **Environmental Noise**: X/Y-axis fluctuations (e.g., -15.9 μT at sample 80) indicate magnetic interference but no systematic heading changes. This rules out **Car** (sustained directional shifts).  
- **Z-axis Stability**: Dominant vertical alignment (-32.1 to -35.7 μT) supports upright posture without drastic reorientation.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The combined **rhythmic accelerometer dips**, **pitch-oriented gyroscope oscillations**, and **absence of high-frequency/high-amplitude signals** confirm **Walking** as the activity. Transient gyroscope spikes reflect natural balance adjustments during gait.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s Duration)

- **y-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -16.2 to -20.1 μT (environmental interference).  
  - **Gradual Decline**: From -19.8 to -16.2 μT (samples 70–100), likely due to lateral movement in a varying magnetic field.  

- **z-axis**:  
  - **Dominant Axis**: -32.1 to -35.7 μT (consistent with vertical alignment).  
  - **Outliers**: Extreme dips (e.g., -35.7 μT at sample 90) suggest device reorientation or external magnetic disturbances.  

---

### **Key Observations**  
1. **Activity Type**:  
   - **Rhythmic Motion**: Accelerometer y-axis gravity alignment and gyroscope oscillations suggest upright posture with periodic torso movements (e.g., walking or light exercise).  
   - **Sudden Actions**: Gyroscope spikes (x/y-axis) and accelerometer dips indicate intermittent bends, turns, or steps.  

2. **Orientation Stability**:  
   - Magnetometer z-axis stability implies minimal heading changes, while x/y-axis shifts correlate with lateral motion in a magnetically noisy environment.  

3. **Anomalies**:  
   - **Sample 80**: Concurrent x-axis gyro spike (0.52 rad/s) and magnetometer x-axis drop (-15.9 μT) suggest a sharp torso roll with orientation change.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **upright torso motion** with intermittent **dynamic movements** (leans, turns) superimposed on a stable gravitational baseline. Magnetometer noise hints at environmental interference, while gyroscope spikes highlight transient rotational actions. Likely activities include **walking with occasional directional changes** or **light exercise routines**."

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Evidence**  
- **Z-axis Free-Fall**: At ~7 sec, the z-axis acceleration plummets to **-8.09 m/s²**, indicating **momentary weightlessness** (classic free-fall signature). This is inconsistent with steady-state activities like walking, running, or being in a car.  
- **X/Y-axis Spikes**:  
  - X-axis drops to **3.14 m/s²** (forward/backward tilt) and rebounds sharply to **4.63 m/s²** (impact/recovery).  
  - Y-axis surges to **10.59 m/s²** (violent lateral motion, e.g., stumble or collision).  
  These abrupt changes rule out ""Still"" or ""Car"" (vehicle motion typically lacks such extreme torso reorientation).  

### **2. Gyroscope Evidence**  
- **X-axis Spike**: Peaks at **1.76 rad/s** (rapid torso rotation, e.g., falling forward/backward).  
- **Y-axis Dip**: Sharp negative swing (**-1.41 rad/s**) followed by erratic oscillations (loss of balance, recovery attempts).  
  Such rotational dynamics are inconsistent with walking/running (rhythmic patterns) or car motion (smooth turns/braking).  

### **3. Magnetometer Evidence**  
- **Y-axis Steep Drop**: From **-19 µT** to **-37.06 µT** (sudden torso reorientation, aligning with fall dynamics).  
- **Z-axis Stabilization**: Post-event stabilization at **-31.49 µT** (recovery phase, consistent with reorientation after impact).  

### **4. Temporal Sequence**  
- **0–7 sec**: Stable accelerometer baselines (~4.2–4.5 m/s² on x-axis, ~8.1–8.4 m/s² on y-axis) suggest upright motion (e.g., walking).  
- **7 sec**: Synchronized free-fall (z-axis), gyroscope spikes, and magnetometer shifts confirm a **sudden fall**.  
- **7–10 sec**: Accelerometer rebounds and gyroscope oscillations indicate recovery (standing up, rebalancing).  

### **Elimination of Other Categories**  
- **Still**: Pre-7 sec motion and post-7 sec recovery phase invalidate this.  
- **Walking/Running**: Lacks abrupt free-fall signatures and violent rotational spikes.  
- **Car**: Vehicle motion would show sustained lateral/linear accelerations (e.g., braking, turns), not free-fall or torso reorientation.  

### **Conclusion**  
The IMU data reflects a **fall-recovery sequence**, characterized by free-fall, impact, and reorientation. While ""Fall"" is not explicitly listed in the provided categories, the sensor dynamics overwhelmingly support this interpretation over the given options. If forced to choose from the categories, **""Still""** might be erroneously selected for the recovery phase, but the dominant event is unequivocally a **fall**.","The IMU data from the torso-mounted smartphone exhibits **dynamic motion with abrupt transitions**, likely corresponding to a **sudden activity change or fall-recovery sequence**. Below is the analysis of trends and distributions:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Trends**  
#### **X-axis**  
- **Stable baseline**: ~4.2–4.5 m/s² (gravity-aligned torso orientation).  
- **Sharp drop at ~7 sec**: Plunges to **3.14 m/s²** (sudden forward/backward tilt or motion initiation).  
- **Post-drop instability**: Peaks at **4.63 m/s²** (recovery jerk) before stabilizing.  

#### **Y-axis**  
- **High baseline**: ~8.1–8.4 m/s² (lateral forces from torso sway).  
- **Spike at ~7 sec**: Surges to **10.59 m/s²** (violent lateral motion, e.g., stumble or collision).  
- **Post-spike oscillation**: Returns to ~8.2 m/s² (rebalancing).  

#### **Z-axis**  
- **Initial stability**: ~2.8–3.1 m/s² (vertical gravity component).  
- **Free-fall signature**: Plummets to **-8.09 m/s²** (momentary weightlessness, e.g., fall or jump).  
- **Recovery**: Rebounds to **1.64 m/s²** (impact or reorientation).  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Trends**  
#### **X-axis**  
- **Baseline drift**: -0.13 to 0.07 rad/s (minor torso rotations).  
- **Violent spike at ~7 sec**: Peaks at **1.76 rad/s** (rapid forward/backward roll, e.g., fall).  
- **Post-spike oscillations**: Negative dips (reorientation efforts).  

#### **Y-axis**  
- **Irregular fluctuations**: -0.54 to 0.12 rad/s (side-to-side rotations).  
- **Post-7 sec activity**: Sharp negative dip (**-1.41 rad/s**) followed by erratic swings (loss of balance).  

#### **Z-axis**  
- **Mild baseline**: -0.25 to 0.15 rad/s (twisting motions).  
- **Post-event noise**: Increased variability (device reorientation).  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **X-axis**: Gradual decline from **-12.12 µT** to **-16.87 µT** (heading change).  
- **Y-axis**: Steep drop from **-19 µT** to **-37.06 µT** (large spatial reorientation).  
- **Z-axis**: Fluctuates near **-33 µT** but stabilizes at **-31.49 µT** (alignment with Earth’s field post-motion).  

---

### **Key Observations**  
1. **Fall/Impact Signature**  
   - Accelerometer z-axis **free-fall** and gyroscope x-axis **spike** suggest a **sudden fall** at ~7 sec.  
   - Magnetometer y-axis drop aligns with torso reorientation during the event.  

2. **Recovery Phase**  
   - Post-7 sec accelerometer rebounds and gyroscope oscillations indicate **recovery motions** (e.g., standing up).  

3. **Noise & Artifacts**  
   - Magnetometer z-axis drift may reflect environmental interference rather than motion.  

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**  
The data strongly suggests a **fall followed by recovery**:  
- **0–7 sec**: Normal motion (walking/standing).  
- **7 sec**: Fall (z-axis free-fall, gyroscope spike).  
- **7–10 sec**: Impact and reorientation (accelerometer rebound, gyroscope noise).  

This aligns with torso-mounted IMU dynamics during falls, where abrupt sensor shifts correlate with impact and recovery."

### **Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

#### **1. Accelerometer Context**  
- **Y-axis (≈8 m/s²):** Near-constant gravity-aligned values confirm the phone remains upright on the torso throughout the 10-second window.  
- **X-axis spike (5.86 m/s² at ~5 sec):** Short-lived forward acceleration, likely due to a **minor torso adjustment** (e.g., shifting weight, coughing).  
- **Z-axis dip (-1.2 m/s²):** Sharp upward acceleration (negative Z) at 5–6 sec, but **magnitude is low** (~1.2 m/s²) compared to intentional motions like standing (typically >2 m/s²). The quick recovery to baseline (2.4 m/s²) suggests minimal displacement.  

**Key Insight:** The Z-axis dip lacks the sustained amplitude or directional shift of a full sit-to-stand motion.  

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **Y-axis (pitch) peak (+0.87 rad/s):** Forward rotation, but **short duration** (~1 sec). This aligns with a brief torso lean (e.g., reaching for an object) rather than a full postural change.  
- **X-axis (roll) oscillation (-0.75 to +0.5 rad/s):** Minor sideways tilting, consistent with **natural balance adjustments** during seated or stationary activity.  
- **Z-axis (yaw) stabilization:** No sustained turning motion, ruling out Car-like directional changes.  

**Critical Point:** Gyroscope spikes are transient and lack the rhythmicity of Walking/Run or the sustained rotation of Car turns.  

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Stability**  
- **Z-axis dip (-30 → -20 µT):** Reflects a brief reorientation, but **noise dominates** (~5 µT fluctuations). This is likely environmental interference (e.g., nearby metal objects) rather than torso motion.  
- **X/Y-axis drift:** Gradual changes suggest minor device rotation, but no coherent directional shift.  

**Interpretation:** Magnetometer noise and drift are inconsistent with the sharp, intentional motions of Walking/Run or Car.  

---

#### **4. Activity Elimination**  
- **Walking/Run:** No periodic accelerometer/gyroscope patterns (e.g., step cycles). The 5-sec event is isolated, not repeated.  
- **Car:** No sustained lateral acceleration (X/Y-axis) or yaw rotation (gyroscope Z-axis) indicative of turning/braking.  
- **Dynamic motions (sit-to-stand, bending):** Require larger, sustained accelerations (e.g., Z-axis >2 m/s² for sit-to-stand) and prolonged gyroscope activity.  

---

### **Final Conclusion**  
The dominant sensor signature is **baseline stability** (gravity-aligned accelerometer, low gyroscope noise) with a **brief, low-intensity torso adjustment** at ~5 seconds. This aligns with **Still** activity, where minor movements (e.g., adjusting posture, reaching) occur but do not constitute locomotion or deliberate postural transitions.","The provided IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) exhibits distinct trends that suggest **a dynamic torso movement followed by stabilization**, likely involving **postural changes and rotational motion**. Below is the analysis of key elements and their trend distributions:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Trends**  
**Main Observations:**  
- **Y-axis (≈8 m/s²):** Dominated by near-constant high values, aligning with gravity’s projection on the torso’s vertical axis.  
- **X-axis (4–5.8 m/s²):** Stable baseline (~4.5 m/s²) with a **sharp spike at ~5 seconds** (peaking at 5.86 m/s²), indicating forward/backward acceleration (e.g., torso lean or recovery).  
- **Z-axis (1.7 → 3.0 → -1.2 → recovery):**  
  - Initial stability (1.7–3.0 m/s²) suggests upright posture.  
  - **Sharp drop to -1.2 m/s² at 5–6 seconds** (negative Z implies upward acceleration, e.g., rapid torso lift or sit-to-stand motion).  
  - Gradual recovery to ~2.4 m/s² post-event.  

**Key Event:** A **sudden vertical motion** (e.g., standing up, bending forward) around the 5-second mark, followed by stabilization.

---

### **2. Gyroscope Trends**  
**Rotational Dynamics:**  
- **X-axis (roll):** Oscillates between -0.75 to +0.5 rad/s. **Peak negative rotation at 5 seconds** (torso tilting sideways).  
- **Y-axis (pitch):** Large swing from **-0.4 to +0.87 rad/s**, peaking at 5 seconds (forward/backward torso rotation).  
- **Z-axis (yaw):** Gradual increase to **+0.35 rad/s**, then stabilization (slow turning motion).  

**Critical Insight:** Combined spikes in X and Y axes at 5–6 seconds confirm **rapid rotational motion** (e.g., torso twist or recovery from imbalance).

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
**Orientation Changes:**  
- All axes show **noisy but correlated fluctuations**, reflecting shifts in the device’s orientation relative to Earth’s magnetic field.  
- **Z-axis (≈-30 µT → -20 µT):** Sharp dip at 5–6 seconds, aligning with the accelerometer/gyroscope event (torso reorientation).  
- **X/Y-axis:** Gradual drift post-event, suggesting stabilization.  

**Interpretation:** The magnetometer supports a **brief reorientation** (e.g., torso tilt or turn) followed by steady-state alignment.

---

### **4. Activity Hypothesis**  
The synchronized sensor trends suggest:  
1. **Initial Stability (0–4 sec):** Upright posture with minor movements.  
2. **Dynamic Phase (4–6 sec):**  
   - **Rapid vertical motion** (accelerometer Z-axis drop).  
   - **Rotational spike** (gyroscope Y/X-axis peaks).  
   - Likely a **sit-to-stand motion**, **forward bend**, or **recovery from stumble**.  
3. **Post-Event Stabilization (6–10 sec):** Gradual return to baseline.

**Conclusion:** The data captures a **brief, intense torso movement** (likely postural change) with rotational components, followed by stabilization. This pattern aligns with activities like **standing up quickly, avoiding a fall, or dynamic bending**. Magnetometer noise hints at environmental interference but does not obscure the primary motion signature."

**Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Patterns:**  
   - **Z-axis Plunge (-8.34 m/s²):** A sharp negative spike in vertical acceleration at ~5.5 seconds indicates **free-fall**, a hallmark of sudden downward motion (e.g., collapsing or tripping).  
   - **Post-Impact Stabilization:** After the fall (7–10 seconds), acceleration values stabilize at lower baselines (~2.5–4.5 m/s² on x-axis, ~1.0–2.8 m/s² on z-axis), consistent with a motionless state (e.g., lying down).  
   - **Lateral Y-axis Spikes (12.34 m/s²):** Extreme lateral forces suggest impact or imbalance during the fall but do not correlate with sustained motion like walking/running.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics:**  
   - **Rotational Spikes (Roll: 1.23 rad/s, Pitch/Yaw: ~±1.09 rad/s):** Transient rotational surges at 5–6 seconds align with tumbling during a fall. Post-event, gyroscope values return to near-zero, indicating **no ongoing motion** (e.g., no steps or vehicle movement).  

3. **Magnetometer Reorientation:**  
   - **Drastic Shifts (x-axis: -20.44 μT, z-axis: -0.12 μT):** Sudden changes in magnetic field orientation confirm the device moved from upright to horizontal (e.g., torso impacting the ground). Post-fall stabilization at new baselines suggests **no further reorientation**, reinforcing a stationary state.  

4. **Temporal Phasing:**  
   - **0–5 sec:** Minor fluctuations suggest pre-fall stillness or slow walking.  
   - **5–7 sec:** Critical fall event (free-fall, impact, tumbling).  
   - **7–10 sec:** Motion cessation. Sensor baselines stabilize, reflecting a **still posture** (e.g., lying down).  

**Conclusion:**  
While the 5–7-second window captures a fall, the **dominant activity across the 10-second interval** is **post-fall stillness**. The absence of periodic signals (e.g., step cycles for walking/running) or sustained vibrations (e.g., car motion) supports classifying this as **Still**. The fall itself is an acute event within the broader stationary context.","The IMU data collected from the torso-mounted smartphone reveals a **dynamic activity event** characterized by abrupt sensor trends, likely indicating a **sudden movement or fall**. Here's a breakdown of the key elements and trend distributions:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Analysis**
- **X-axis (Forward/Backward):**  
  - Stable baseline (~4.8–5.0 m/s²) initially, followed by a sharp **drop to ~3.0 m/s²** (samples 60–70) and a transient spike to **5.95 m/s²** (sample 60).  
  - Post-event stabilization at lower values (~2.5–4.5 m/s²), suggesting altered posture or motion damping.  

- **Y-axis (Lateral):**  
  - Baseline ~8.0–8.2 m/s² initially, with **extreme spikes to 12.34 m/s²** (sample 55) and **11.75 m/s²** (sample 53). These peaks suggest forceful lateral motion or imbalance.  

- **Z-axis (Vertical):**  
  - Initial stability (~2.0–2.5 m/s²), then a **plunge to -8.34 m/s²** (sample 55), indicative of free-fall or sudden downward acceleration.  
  - Gradual recovery post-event (~1.0–2.8 m/s²), consistent with impact or reorientation.  

**Event Correlation:** The simultaneous negative z-axis spike and lateral y-axis surge around **5–6 seconds** strongly suggest a **loss of balance or fall**, followed by impact and stabilization.

---

### **2. Gyroscope Analysis**
- **X-axis (Roll):**  
  - Quiet initially (near 0 rad/s), then **spikes to 1.23 rad/s** (sample 60), signaling rapid rolling motion.  
  - Post-event oscillations settle near baseline, implying motion cessation.  

- **Y-axis (Pitch):**  
  - Transient **negative surge to -1.09 rad/s** (sample 55), followed by erratic swings (e.g., 0.67 rad/s at sample 65), indicating pitching/tumbling.  

- **Z-axis (Yaw):**  
  - Sharp **negative spike to -1.09 rad/s** (sample 55) and oscillations, suggesting rotational instability during the event.  

**Event Correlation:** High rotational velocities (roll/pitch/yaw) align with a **tumbling motion** during the fall, followed by damped oscillations post-impact.

---

### **3. Magnetometer Analysis**
- **X/Y/Z Axes:**  
  - Gradual baseline drift initially, followed by **extreme shifts** (e.g., x-axis: -20.44 μT at sample 65; z-axis: -0.12 μT at sample 75).  
  - Post-event stabilization at new baselines, reflecting a **changed device orientation** (e.g., lying flat vs. upright).  

**Event Correlation:** Sudden magnetic field shifts confirm rapid reorientation, consistent with a fall to the ground and subsequent stationary position.

---

### **Activity Summary**
- **Phase 1 (0–5 sec):** Stable motion (e.g., walking/standing) with minor sensor fluctuations.  
- **Phase 2 (5–7 sec):** **Critical event**—drastic accelerometer/gyroscope spikes and magnetometer reorientation, consistent with a **fall** (free-fall, impact, and tumbling).  
- **Phase 3 (7–10 sec):** Post-impact stabilization, with sensors returning to new baselines (e.g., lying down).  

---

### **Key Insights**
- **Fall Signature:** The synchronized z-axis acceleration drop, gyroscopic tumbling, and magnetometer reorientation are hallmarks of a **forward/lateral fall** with torso impact.  
- **Environmental Context:** Magnetometer shifts post-fall suggest minimal external magnetic interference, reinforcing orientation change as the cause.  
- **Recovery Pattern:** Gradual sensor stabilization implies minimal post-fall movement (e.g., remaining on the ground).  

This analysis aligns with **fall detection** scenarios in human activity recognition, critical for healthcare or safety applications. Further validation (e.g., video correlation) would strengthen conclusions."

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Evidence**  
- **Initial Burst (0–2 seconds):**  
  - A sharp **x-axis spike (9.19 m/s²)** at 2.1 seconds aligns with a forceful forward step, characteristic of gait initiation.  
  - Corresponding **z-axis dip (-0.77 m/s²)** reflects vertical unloading as weight shifts during stepping.  
- **Stabilization Phase (5–10 seconds):**  
  - **x-axis stabilizes to 4–5 m/s²**, consistent with rhythmic forward acceleration during steady walking.  
  - Reduced **z-axis variance** suggests consistent vertical motion (e.g., repetitive steps).  
- **Baseline Gravity (y-axis ~8–10 m/s²):** Confirms the phone remains upright, ruling out erratic motions (e.g., jumping or car turns).  

### **2. Gyroscope Corroboration**  
- **Pitch/Roll Dynamics (0–2 seconds):**  
  - **x-axis** pitch rotation (-0.5 → +0.5 rad/s) matches forward lean during step initiation.  
  - **y-axis** roll peak (0.46 rad/s) coincides with torso adjustment for balance.  
- **Steady-State (5–10 seconds):**  
  - Minimal **z-axis yaw fluctuations** (±0.05 rad/s) indicate stable torso alignment, ruling out erratic activities like running or car rides.  

### **3. Magnetometer Context**  
- **Gradual x-axis shift (-11 → -21 µT)** suggests slight torso rotation during walking, not abrupt turns (e.g., car).  
- **Stable y-axis (-42 µT)** reinforces upright posture, inconsistent with seated car motion.  

### **4. Elimination of Alternatives**  
- **Still:** Excluded due to dynamic accelerometer/gyroscope activity.  
- **Run:** Higher x-axis variance (>10 m/s²) and gyroscope peaks (e.g., >1 rad/s) expected.  
- **Car:** Sustained vibrations, sharper magnetometer shifts (e.g., turns), or prolonged acceleration (>5 s) absent.  

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **gait initiation** (initial spike) transitioning to **steady walking** (rhythmic x-axis accelerations, stable rotation). This matches the torso-mounted sensor’s sensitivity to step-related motion and postural adjustments during walking.","The IMU data captures torso-mounted sensor readings over 10 seconds. Below is a structured analysis of trends and key elements in the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Trends**
- **Baseline Gravity**:  
  - The **y-axis** consistently measures **~8–10 m/s²**, indicating gravity primarily aligns with this axis. This suggests the smartphone is upright (y-axis vertical) during most of the activity.

  - **Stabilization Phase (After ~5 seconds)**:  
    - **x-axis** stabilizes to **4–5 m/s²**, indicating reduced horizontal motion.  
    - **z-axis** oscillations diminish, stabilizing near **-0.2 m/s²** (return to steady posture).

- **Noise in Static Phases**:  
  - Post-spike, **x/y/z** axes show minor fluctuations (~±0.5 m/s²), likely due to breathing or subtle torso adjustments.

---

### **2. Gyroscope Trends**
- **Rotational Dynamics**:  
  - **Initial Movement (0–2 seconds)**:

    - **y-axis** peaks at **0.46 rad/s** (roll) during the spike, correlating with the accelerometer’s x-axis event.  
  - **Mid-Activity (2–5 seconds)**:  
    - **z-axis** fluctuates between **-0.3 to +0.3 rad/s**, hinting at slight yaw rotations (e.g., torso twists).  
  - **Stabilization (5–10 seconds)**:  
    - All axes show minimal oscillations (**±0.05 rad/s**), indicating reduced rotational motion.

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**
- **Orientation-Dependent Shifts**:  
  - **x-axis**: Declines from **-11 µT** to **-21 µT** (alignment shift with Earth’s magnetic field), then recovers, suggesting torso rotation.  
  - **y-axis**: Stable near **-42 µT** (consistent with upright orientation).  
  - **z-axis**: Rises from **20 µT** to **27 µT** (heightened vertical magnetic flux), likely due to reorientation during motion.

---

### **Summary of Activity Phases**
1. **Initial Burst (0–2 seconds)**:  
   - Sudden forward acceleration (x-axis spike).  
   - Pitch/roll rotations (gyroscope peaks).  
   - Likely a dynamic movement (e.g., jump, step, or lunge).  

2. **Transition (2–5 seconds)**:  
   - Gradual stabilization of accelerations.  
   - Minor torso twists (z-axis gyroscope fluctuations).  

3. **Steady State (5–10 seconds)**:  
   - Reduced motion (low accelerometer/gyroscope variance).  
   - Possible return to upright stance or walking at constant velocity.  

---

### **Key Inferences**
- **Primary Activity**: A **burst of forward motion** (e.g., stepping, jumping) followed by stabilization.  
- **Orientation**: Smartphone remains upright (y-axis vertical) with intermittent torso rotations.  
- **Noise Sources**: Minor postural adjustments dominate later phases, while the initial spike suggests intentional movement.  

This data aligns with activities like **transitioning from rest to motion** (e.g., standing up, initiating a walk/run) or a **single explosive movement** (e.g., jump) followed by recovery."

**Analysis:**  
1. **Initial Dynamic Phase (0–3 sec):**  
   - **Accelerometer X-axis** spikes sharply (3.7 → 7.1 m/s²), indicating forceful forward acceleration.  
   - **Gyroscope X-axis** shows large pitch rotation (-0.57 → +0.58 rad/s), aligning with torso movement.  
   - **Magnetometer X/Y** fluctuations suggest torso rotation during this phase.  
   - **Interpretation:** Likely a **rapid sit-to-stand transition** or forward bend, not sustained motion like walking/running.  

2. **Stabilization (3–7 sec):**  
   - Accelerometer magnitudes return to baseline (~3.3 m/s² on X-axis, ~9 m/s² on Y-axis).  
   - Gyroscope noise diminishes (near-zero rotation), indicating reduced movement.  
   - **Magnetometer Z-axis** stabilizes (10 → 25 µT), confirming upright posture.  

3. **Steady State (7–10 sec):**  
   - Minimal fluctuations in all sensors (e.g., accelerometer X: ±0.3 m/s², gyroscope: ±0.05 rad/s).  
   - **Y-axis accelerometer** remains gravity-dominated (~9.3 m/s²), confirming stillness.  

**Key Discriminators Against Other Classes:**  
- **Walking/Run:** Would show periodic oscillations (steps) in accelerometer/gyroscope; absent here after 3 seconds.  
- **Car:** Requires sustained lateral/vertical vibrations or turns (e.g., magnetometer reorientation); no such patterns observed.  
- **Still:** Matches the stabilization phase (gravity-dominated Y-axis, minimal motion post-transition).  

**Conclusion:** The data reflects a **brief dynamic action (sit-to-stand)** followed by prolonged stillness, fitting the ""Still"" class due to dominant steady-state behavior.","The IMU data captures a dynamic 10-second torso-mounted activity with distinct sensor trends. Here's a structured analysis:

### **1. Accelerometer Trends**

- **Z-axis (Twist Rotation):**  
  - **Initial Peak (+0.45 rad/s):** Torso twist during the first 2 seconds.  
  - **Negative Swing (-0.47 rad/s):** Counter-rotation at ~3 seconds, possibly balancing the forward motion.  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**
- **X/Y-axis (Horizontal Orientation):**  
  - **X:** Fluctuates between -10 µT (north) and -24 µT (south), suggesting torso rotation relative to Earth’s magnetic field.

- **Z-axis (Vertical Field):**  
  - **Gradual Rise (10 → 25 µT):** Increasing alignment with Earth’s vertical field, consistent with upright stabilization.  

---

### **Key Activity Phases**
1. **Dynamic Phase (0–3 sec):**  
   - Forward acceleration (x-axis spike) with vertical lift (z-axis) and strong pitch rotation (gyro x).  
   - Likely a **rapid sit-to-stand motion** or **forward bend**.  

2. **Stabilization Phase (3–7 sec):**  
   - Reduced acceleration/rotation magnitudes; magnetometer z-axis stabilizes, suggesting upright posture.  

3. **Steady State (7–10 sec):**  
   - Minimal fluctuations in all sensors, indicating standing still or slow sway.  

---

### **Summary of Trends**
- **Accelerometer:** Forward thrust → vertical lift → stabilization.  
- **Gyroscope:** Pitch-dominated rotation → balanced adjustments.  
- **Magnetometer:** Gradual alignment with Earth’s field post-movement.  

**Activity Hypothesis:** A **rapid transition from sitting to standing** or **forceful forward bending**, followed by postural stabilization. The torso-mounted sensor effectively captures gravity-dominated baseline shifts and dynamic rotational forces."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Dynamics**:
   - **Y-Axis Gravity Drop**: Initial Y-axis values (~9.3 m/s²) confirm upright posture. A sharp decline to ~7.4 m/s² (samples 80–100) indicates forward lean or dynamic motion, inconsistent with *Still* or *Car*.
   - **X-Axis Sustained Acceleration**: Peaks >6 m/s² (samples 85–100) exceed walking thresholds (~1–3 m/s²). This matches **running**-level forward propulsion.
   - **Z-Axis Vertical Motion**: Transition from negative (tilted torso) to positive spikes (up to 1.17 m/s²) aligns with vertical forces from running strides.

2. **Gyroscope Rotational Evidence**:
   - **Z-Axis Rotation**: Gradual increase to **0.58 rad/s** (samples 80–100) reflects torso twisting during a directional turn, incompatible with *Still* or *Car*.
   - **Late-Stage Spikes**: Y-axis spike (-0.61 rad/s) and X-axis fluctuations suggest abrupt motion changes, ruling out cyclic *Walking*.

3. **Magnetometer Orientation**:
   - **X-Axis Decline (-10 µT → -23 µT)**: Indicates a ~180° turn, corroborated by gyroscope Z-axis rotation. This directional shift is atypical for *Walking* or *Car* (which would show smoother heading changes).

4. **Temporal Phases**:
   - **0–5 sec**: Low acceleration/rotation suggests initial stillness or slow walking.
   - **5–7 sec**: Rising X/Z accelerations and dropping Y-axis mark transition to running.
   - **7–10 sec**: Peak X acceleration (>6 m/s²), vertical Z spikes, and sustained Z-axis rotation confirm **running with a turn**.

5. **Exclusion of Alternatives**:
   - *Still*: Ruled out by dynamic accelerations/rotations.
   - *Walking*: Insufficient periodicity in accelerations; X-axis peaks too high.
   - *Car**: No engine vibration patterns or smooth gyroscope trends (abrupt torso motion invalidates vehicle motion).

**Conclusion**: The data reflects a transition from rest to **running**, with a directional turn (evidenced by Z-axis gyroscope rotation and magnetometer reorientation). High forward acceleration (X-axis) and vertical motion (Z-axis) are definitive for *Run*.","### Analysis of IMU Data for Torso-Mounted Smartphone

#### **1. Accelerometer Trends**:
- **Static Gravity Component**:
  - **Y-axis**: Dominated by gravity (~9.3–9.4 m/s² initially), confirming the torso’s upright orientation. A **sharp drop** in later samples (to ~7.4 m/s²) suggests a dynamic motion (e.g., forward lean, jumping, or running) redistributing the gravity vector.
  - **X-axis**: Stable around 3 m/s² initially, then **sharp rise** to >6 m/s² (samples 80–100), indicating sustained forward acceleration (e.g., sprinting or abrupt movement).
  - **Z-axis**: Starts negative (tilted orientation), transitions to **positive values** (up to 1.17 m/s²), suggesting vertical motion (e.g., jumping or torso lift).

- **Dynamic Motion**:
  - **Peaks**: X and Z accelerations surge to 6.25 m/s² and 1.17 m/s², respectively (samples 85–100). This aligns with high-intensity activity (e.g., running strides or jumping).

#### **2. Gyroscope Trends**:
- **Rotational Dynamics**:
  - **Z-axis**: Gradual increase to **0.58 rad/s** (samples 80–100), indicating sustained torso rotation (e.g., turning or twisting).
  - **X/Y-axes**: Transient spikes (e.g., X-axis: **-0.41 rad/s** at sample 80) suggest abrupt tilting or jolts.
  - **Late-stage spikes** (e.g., Y-axis: **-0.61 rad/s**) correlate with rapid directional changes.

#### **3. Magnetometer Trends**:
- **Orientation Shifts**:
  - **X-axis**: Steady decline from -10 µT to -23 µT, suggesting a **~180° turn** (e.g., changing direction while moving).
  - **Y/Z-axes**: Smaller fluctuations, likely noise or minor orientation adjustments.

---

### **Activity Inference**:
1. **Initial Phase (0–5 sec)**:
   - **Stable posture** (gravity-aligned Y-axis).
   - Low accelerations/rotations: Likely **standing** or **slow walking**.

2. **Transition Phase (5–7 sec)**:
   - Y-axis gravity component drops; X/Z accelerations rise.
   - **Increased forward motion** (e.g., transitioning to a **brisk walk** or **jog**).

3. **High-Intensity Phase (7–10 sec)**:
   - **X-axis acceleration >6 m/s²** (sprinting/running).
   - Z-axis positive spikes (vertical motion from strides/jumps).
   - Gyroscope Z-axis rotation (torso twist or turn).
   - Magnetometer confirms **directional change** (turn).

---

### **Summary**:
- **Key Elements**:
  - Gravity redistribution (Y-axis drop) → Dynamic motion.
  - Sustained forward/vertical acceleration → Running or jumping.
  - Rotational spikes → Torso twisting/turning.
- **Trend Distribution**:
  - **Non-periodic, abrupt changes** rule out cyclic activities (e.g., regular walking).
  - **Late-stage intensity** suggests a **burst of motion** (e.g., sprinting with a turn).

**Likely Activity**: **Running with a directional turn** (e.g., navigating a path or obstacle). The data aligns with a transition from rest to high-intensity movement, accompanied by torso rotation and reorientation."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Patterns:**  
   - **Y-axis (gravity-aligned):** Sustained high values (7.5–8.5 m/s²) indicate an upright posture with minimal vertical torso displacement, inconsistent with Walking/Run (which show periodic gait-related oscillations).  
   - **X-axis:** Two isolated spikes (~2s and ~8s) suggest minor torso adjustments (e.g., shifting weight), not rhythmic steps. Walking/Run would exhibit regular peaks at ~1–2 Hz (step frequency).  
   - **Z-axis critical event:** Sharp plunge to –4.27 m/s² at ~7s with recovery. This matches a sudden torso bend (e.g., forward/backward lean) or stumble, not sustained motion.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics:**  
   - **Y-axis rotational spikes:** A negative pitch (–1.23 rad/s at ~6s) followed by positive pitch (0.508 rad/s at ~8s) confirms a single flexion-extension cycle (e.g., bending and recovering). Walking/Run would show rhythmic pitch oscillations synchronized with steps.  
   - **Z-axis (yaw):** Mild fluctuations (–0.14 to 0.27 rad/s) suggest minor head/shoulder turns, not vehicular rotation (Car would show prolonged yaw changes during turns).  

3. **Magnetometer Reorientation:**  
   - **Z-axis surge (17.6 → 41.1 µT):** Sharp alignment with Earth’s vertical field during the ~7s event indicates device reorientation (torso bending forward). Post-event decline (to 18.4 µT) confirms return to upright posture.  
   - **X-axis gradual decline:** Reflects slow heading change (e.g., subtle body rotation), inconsistent with vehicular motion (Car would show abrupt heading shifts during turns).  

4. **Activity Context:**  
   - **No rhythmic periodicity:** Walking/Run require regular step cycles (absent here). Accelerometer X/Z axes lack the 1–2 Hz oscillations typical of gait.  
   - **Single critical event:** The ~7s bend/stumble is isolated, followed by stabilization. Car motion would involve continuous vibrations or lateral forces.  
   - **Magnetometer stability:** Earth’s field alignment (post-event) and minimal Y-axis variance rule out vehicular movement (Car would disrupt magnetometer stability due to metal interference/acceleration).  

**Conclusion:** The data corresponds to a **Still** posture with a brief torso bend/stumble (critical event at ~7s) and recovery. The absence of rhythmic motion or sustained forces excludes Walking, Run, or Car.","The IMU data (10Hz, 10s) from a torso-mounted smartphone reveals distinct patterns in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings.

### **Activity Inference**  
1. **Initial Stability**: Steady upright posture (high Y-axis accelerometer, stable magnetometer).  
2. **Critical Event at ~7s**:  
   - **Z-axis accelerometer plunge** + **Y-axis gyro negative spike** → Likely torso bend or stumble.  
   - Concurrent **magnetometer Z-axis peak** → Device reorientation during the motion.  
3. **Recovery Phase**: Gyroscope y-axis reverses polarity, accelerometer normalizes, magnetometer stabilizes.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Dominance in Y-Axis (Forward Motion):**  
   - The y-axis accelerometer data shows **sustained high values (7.5–8.7 m/s²)** with periodic fluctuations, characteristic of **forward stride dynamics** during walking. Running would exhibit higher peak magnitudes (>10 m/s²), while ""Still"" or ""Car"" would lack such rhythmic forward acceleration.  
   - **Z-axis inversion** (negative drift to -1.4 m/s²) aligns with vertical torso lift during steps, a hallmark of gait. In contrast, ""Car"" would show steadier vertical acceleration (e.g., road vibrations), and ""Run"" would have sharper vertical spikes.  

2. **Gyroscope Moderation (Torso Adjustments):**  
   - **Low-magnitude oscillations** in all gyroscope axes (e.g., yaw peaking at ~0.15 rad/s) suggest natural torso rotations and balance corrections during walking. Running would involve faster, larger rotations (e.g., pronounced arm swings), while ""Car"" might show abrupt yaw changes during turns.  
   - The **absence of sustained rotational spikes** rules out ""Car"" (e.g., sharp steering motions) or ""Run"" (vigorous limb movements).  

3. **Magnetometer Reorientation (Torso Rotation):**  
   - **Steady z-axis increase (17 to 31 µT)** indicates gradual phone/torso rotation relative to Earth’s magnetic field, consistent with walking-induced sway. ""Car"" would show erratic directional changes (e.g., turns), while ""Still"" would lack such trends.  

4. **Periodicity and Magnitude Consistency:**  
   - The **10Hz sampling rate** captures ~5–10 steps (typical walking cadence: 1.5–2 steps/sec). Running would double this frequency.  
   - Accelerometer magnitudes (y-axis ~8 m/s²) align with walking dynamics (running typically exceeds 10 m/s²).  

**Conclusion:** The combined sensor trends—dominant forward acceleration, moderate rotational adjustments, and rhythmic periodicity—strongly indicate **Walking**. ""Run"" is excluded due to insufficient acceleration magnitude, ""Car"" due to lack of abrupt directional/rotational shifts, and ""Still"" due to dynamic sensor variations.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Trends and Key Observations

Below is a breakdown of key elements and their distributions:

---

#### **1. Accelerometer Trends**  
- **X-axis (Lateral Motion):**  
  - Starts at **~6.7 m/s²**, drops sharply to **~4.7 m/s²**, then stabilizes between **4.5–5.2 m/s²** with minor oscillations.  
  - Gradually increases toward the end (**~6.3 m/s²**), indicating sustained lateral acceleration (e.g., side-to-side torso movement).  

- **Y-axis (Forward/Backward Motion):**  
  - Begins at **~6.8 m/s²**, peaks at **~8.7 m/s²**, and remains elevated (**7.5–8.7 m/s²**) with slight fluctuations.

  - Starts near **0.5 m/s²**, spikes briefly (~1.0 m/s²), then trends **negative** (reaching **-1.4 m/s²**).  
  - Negative drift implies **upward acceleration** (e.g., torso lifting or phone orientation shifts).  

**Key Insight:**  
- Y-axis dominates, indicating **forward-biased motion** (e.g., walking).

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Trends**  
- **X-axis (Roll):**  
  - Starts positive (**~0.33 rad/s**), dips negative (**-0.08 rad/s**), then oscillates near zero with occasional spikes.  
  - Low overall magnitude, suggesting minor torso tilting.  

- **Y-axis (Pitch):**  
  - Begins at **0.31 rad/s**, fluctuates widely (peaks at **0.43 rad/s**, dips to **-0.11 rad/s**), then stabilizes near zero.  
  - Early high variability aligns with motion initiation (e.g., stride adjustments).  

- **Z-axis (Yaw):**  
  - Starts negative (**-0.32 rad/s**), transitions to positive (**0.15 rad/s**), then oscillates near zero.  
  - Suggests **rotational motion** (e.g., turning or torso twists).  

**Key Insight:**  
- Gyroscope data reflects **moderate rotational activity** with no dominant axis, typical of gait-related movements.  

---

- **Y-axis:** Trends downward from **-40 to -34 µT** (consistent with directional changes).  
- **Z-axis:** Steady increase from **17 to 31 µT**, indicating significant **orientation shifts** (e.g., phone rotation relative to Earth’s magnetic field).  

**Key Insight:**  
- Magnetometer trends suggest **dynamic reorientation** (e.g., torso rotation or phone movement), corroborating gyroscope data.  

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**  
- **Primary Motion:** **Walking or jogging** (high y-axis acceleration, periodic gyro oscillations).  
- **Secondary Features:**  
  - Lateral sway (x-axis accelerometer variations).  
  - Torso rotation (z-axis gyro/magnetometer trends).  
  - Vertical bounce (z-axis accelerometer inversion).  

---

### **Critical Observations**  
1. **Accelerometer:** Forward motion dominates (y-axis), with lateral/vertical components indicating gait dynamics.  
2. **Gyroscope:** Low-magnitude rotations align with natural torso adjustments during movement.  
3. **Magnetometer:** Orientation shifts suggest phone/torso rotation, not pure translation.  

This data aligns with **human locomotion** (e.g., brisk walking) involving rhythmic forward motion, lateral balance, and minor torso rotations."

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

#### **1. Accelerometer Trends**  
- **X-axis**: The gradual decrease from ~6.0 m/s² to ~5.1 m/s² (≈15% drop) indicates **deceleration in the forward direction**. This is consistent with a vehicle slowing down (e.g., braking or reducing speed).  
- **Y-axis**: The steady rise (~9% increase) suggests **sustained lateral acceleration**, such as a slight rightward drift (if the y-axis is aligned to the right). This aligns with minor steering adjustments or lane changes in a car.  
- **Z-axis**: Stable negative values (sensor oriented upward) with minimal fluctuations confirm **no significant vertical motion**, ruling out activities like jumping or stair-climbing.  

#### **2. Gyroscope Trends**  
- **Y-axis**: The transient pitch rotation (initial positive → negative → stabilization) likely corresponds to **forward/rearward tilt caused by vehicle dynamics** (e.g., braking-induced weight transfer or passenger posture adjustments).  
- **X/Z-axes**: Near-zero values confirm **no sustained roll or yaw**, inconsistent with walking/running (which involve rhythmic torso rotations) or sharp turns.  

#### **3. Magnetometer Stability**  
- All axes show minimal fluctuations, indicating **no major heading changes** (e.g., no U-turns or rapid direction shifts). This supports a controlled, linear motion (e.g., driving straight or gradual lane changes).  

#### **4. Ruling Out Other Activities**  
- **Still**: The lateral acceleration (y-axis) and deceleration (x-axis) contradict a stationary state.  
- **Walking/Running**: Absence of high-frequency periodic spikes in accelerometer/gyroscope (typical of step cycles) and stable magnetometer rule these out.  
- **Car**: Matches all observed trends:  
  - Deceleration (x-axis) = braking.  
  - Lateral acceleration (y-axis) = gentle steering.  
  - Transient pitch (gyro y-axis) = vehicle dynamics or passenger movement.  
  - Magnetometer stability = consistent forward heading.  

### **Conclusion**  
The IMU data aligns with a **person in a decelerating car**, likely slowing down while making minor lateral adjustments (e.g., braking before a turn or lane change). The absence of abrupt motions or step-related patterns confirms this is vehicular movement, not pedestrian activity.","The IMU data from the torso-mounted smartphone (10Hz sampling, 10 seconds) reveals the following trends and key elements:

### **1. Accelerometer Analysis**
- **X-axis**: 
  - **Trend**: Starts at ~6.0 m/s², **gradually decreases** to ~5.1 m/s² (≈15% drop). Minor fluctuations but consistent downward slope.
  - **Interpretation**: Suggests **deceleration** or forward-leaning motion (e.g., slowing down, controlled bending).
  
- **Y-axis**: 
  - **Trend**: Rises from ~7.6 m/s² to ~8.3 m/s² (≈9% increase). Stable upward drift with minor oscillations.
  - **Interpretation**: Likely indicates **lateral movement** (e.g., side-stepping, torso rotation to the right if positive y-axis is rightward).

- **Z-axis**: 
  - **Trend**: Fluctuates between -1.36 m/s² and -0.45 m/s², ending slightly less negative. No dominant directional trend.
  - **Interpretation**: Negative values suggest the sensor’s z-axis is oriented upward (opposite gravity). Stability implies minimal vertical motion (e.g., no jumping).

### **2. Gyroscope Analysis**
- **X-axis**: 
  - **Trend**: Near-zero fluctuations (±0.1 rad/s). Brief negative spikes mid-sequence.
  - **Interpretation**: Minimal roll motion, consistent with steady torso posture.

- **Y-axis**: 
  - **Trend**: Starts positive (~0.15 rad/s), transitions to negative (~-0.2 rad/s), then stabilizes near zero. 
  - **Interpretation**: Initial pitch rotation (forward/backward tilt), followed by correction (e.g., nodding or recovering balance).

- **Z-axis**: 
  - **Trend**: Near-zero (±0.05 rad/s) with minor noise. No sustained rotation.
  - **Interpretation**: Minimal yaw motion (e.g., no sharp turns).

### **3. Magnetometer Analysis**
- **X/Y/Z-axes**: 
  - **Trend**: All axes show **stable offsets** (x: -20 to -14 µT, y: -39 to -34 µT, z: 24–30 µT) with minor fluctuations. No drastic changes in magnetic field orientation.
  - **Interpretation**: Sensor remains in a **consistent orientation** relative to Earth’s magnetic field (e.g., no large directional shifts or environmental interference).

---

### **Summary of Key Elements**
1. **Accelerometer**:
   - **Dominant Motion**: Deceleration in the forward direction (x-axis) + lateral acceleration (y-axis).
   - **Activity Clue**: Likely **controlled lateral movement** (e.g., side-stepping, torso twisting) with gradual stopping.

2. **Gyroscope**:
   - **Dominant Motion**: Transient pitch rotation (y-axis) with minimal roll/yaw.
   - **Activity Clue**: Brief forward/backward tilt (e.g., bending to pick an object, recovering posture).

3. **Magnetometer**:
   - **Stability**: Confirms **no significant heading changes** or environmental magnetic disturbances.

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**
The combined trends suggest **controlled lateral motion with deceleration**, possibly:
- **Sideways stepping** (e.g., avoiding an obstacle),
- **Torso twisting** (e.g., reaching sideways while slowing down),
- **Bending forward** followed by stabilization.

The absence of high-frequency spikes or erratic gyroscope activity rules out abrupt motions (e.g., falls, running). The magnetometer’s stability further supports a structured, low-intensity activity."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Patterns:**  
   - **X-axis (Forward/Backward):** The initial stability (~5.2 m/s²) aligns with steady motion (e.g., walking). The dip (4.6–4.8 m/s²) at 3–5 seconds suggests deceleration, followed by a sharp rise (~6.1 m/s²) at 6 seconds, indicating a forward acceleration burst (e.g., stride adjustment or turning).  
   - **Y-axis (Lateral):** Stable values (~8.0–8.4 m/s²) with dips (7.4–7.9 m/s²) at 5–7 seconds correlate with lateral shifts during a turn or sidestepping while walking.  
   - **Z-axis (Vertical):** Transition from gravity-dominated values (~−1.2 m/s²) to near-zero (samples 70–100) suggests upright stabilization after a torso tilt, consistent with posture adjustments mid-walk.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics:**  
   - **Y-axis (Roll):** Spikes at ~0.25 rad/s (5 seconds) and ~0.22 rad/s (7 seconds) indicate lateral torso rotation during a turn.

   - **X-axis (Pitch):** Minor fluctuations except for a brief spike (0.12 rad/s at 6 seconds), likely from a stride or balance correction.  

3. **Magnetometer Orientation Shifts:**  
   - **X-axis:** Shift from −15 μT to −22 μT (6–7 seconds) aligns with reorientation during a turn.  
   - **Z-axis:** Increase (~25 μT to ~28 μT) and subsequent decrease correlate with vertical tilt during the turn and stabilization.  

4. **Temporal Correlation:**  
   - **5–7 seconds:** Synchronized accelerometer dips, gyroscope spikes, and magnetometer shifts confirm a **turn** mid-activity.  
   - **Post-7 seconds:** Stabilizing accelerometer (z-axis near zero) and reduced gyroscope activity suggest resumption of steady walking.  

5. **Eliminating Other Activities:**  
   - **Still:** Ruled out due to dynamic accelerometer/gyroscope fluctuations.  
   - **Run:** Absence of high-frequency periodic peaks (typical in running) and lower vertical acceleration range (~−1.2 to 0 m/s² vs. higher ranges for running).  
   - **Car:** No cyclic vibrations or sustained lateral/vertical shifts (e.g., braking/acceleration patterns would show smoother trends).  

**Conclusion:** The data reflects **walking with a mid-activity turn**, characterized by forward acceleration, lateral shifts, torso rotation, and magnetic reorientation, followed by stabilization.","The IMU data from the torso-mounted smartphone reveals distinct trends in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings, suggesting a combination of dynamic body movements and orientation changes.

- **Y-axis:**  
  - Stable around −38 to −40 μT, with minor fluctuations. Consistent with lateral alignment during motion.  

- **Z-axis:**

---

### **Key Observations**

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Patterns:**  
   - **Y-axis (Forward-Backward):** Sustained high values (~7.8–8.9 m/s²) dominate the signal. This aligns with forward locomotion (walking/running), as gravity (~9.8 m/s²) combined with forward acceleration explains the elevated baseline.  
   - **Z-axis (Vertical):** A sharp spike (0.6–1.5 m/s²) at **1–3 seconds** corresponds to step initiation (e.g., heel strike or torso lift). Subsequent stabilization near gravity (~9.8 m/s² minus offsets) suggests rhythmic vertical motion consistent with walking strides.  
   - **X-axis (Lateral):** Minor fluctuations (~4.7–6.1 m/s²) reflect steady torso alignment, ruling out erratic motions (e.g., car turns).  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics:**  
   - **X-axis (Pitch/Roll):** Oscillations (e.g., -0.42–0.25 rad/s) match torso rotation during strides. Stabilization after initial dips indicates a steady gait.  
   - **Z-axis (Vertical Rotation):** Gradual shift from negative to positive (twisting) aligns with stride-related hip rotation, not sharp turns (which would show abrupt magnetometer changes).  

3. **Magnetometer Stability:**  
   - Minimal deviations in X/Y-axes (-40–-15 µT) suggest no significant heading changes, ruling out car-like turns. The gradual Z-axis decline (23→20 µT) likely reflects slight phone tilting during motion, not environmental interference.  

4. **Key Differentiators from Other Activities:**  
   - **Run vs. Walk:** Y-axis accelerations (7.8–8.9 m/s²) are lower than typical running (>10 m/s²). Vertical spikes (1.5 m/s²) and gyroscope magnitudes (-0.42–0.25 rad/s) also align better with walking intensity.  
   - **Car:** No abrupt directional changes (magnetometer stability) or high-frequency vibrations (seen in accelerometer noise).  
   - **Still:** Sustained Y-axis acceleration and vertical spikes contradict inactivity.  

**Conclusion:** The data reflects **walking**—rhythmic forward motion with step-related vertical spikes, stable heading, and torso rotations. The initial z-axis spike likely marks step initiation, followed by a steady gait.","**Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis**

- **Z-axis (vertical):**  
  - **Range:** ~-0.4–1.5 m/s².  
  - **Key Feature:** Sharp spike (0.6–1.5 m/s²) at **seconds 1–3**, likely a vertical motion (e.g., step, jump, or torso lift). Values stabilize near gravity (~9.8 m/s² minus offsets) afterward.  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Data**  
- **X-axis (pitch/roll):**

- **Z-axis (vertical rotation):**  
  - **Range:** -0.25–0.15 rad/s.  
  - **Trend:** Gradual shift from negative to positive (twisting/turning), stabilizing with noise (consistent stride rotation?).  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Data**  
- **X/Y-axes:**  
  - **Range:** -40–-15 µT (X), -41–-37 µT (Y).  
  - **Trend:** Stable with minor deviations, reflecting environmental magnetic field changes (not torso motion).  

- **Z-axis:**  
  - **Range:** 13–24 µT.  
  - **Trend:** Gradual decline (initial ~23 µT to ~20 µT), likely due to orientation shifts (e.g., phone tilting during motion).  

---

### **Activity Inference**  
- **Primary Motion:** **Walking/Running**  
  - Sustained y-axis acceleration (forward motion) + vertical z-axis spike (step/jump initiation).  
  - Gyroscopic x-axis oscillations align with torso rotation during strides.  

- **Secondary Features:**  
  - Initial vertical acceleration spike suggests abrupt movement (e.g., standing up, step initiation).  
  - Magnetometer stability implies minimal heading changes (linear path or indoor environment).  

---

### **Key Observations**  
1. **Accelerometer:** Forward motion dominates (y-axis), with transient vertical activity.  
2. **Gyroscope:** Torso rotations stabilize after initial adjustments.  
3. **Magnetometer:** Environmental noise overshadows motion-related changes.  

This data aligns with **locomotion activities** (walking/jogging) with a brief vertical motion at the start. For precise classification, further processing (e.g., step detection, orientation alignment) would be required."
529,1498128543460,1498128553450,Still,Walking,"<<Walking>>  
**Step-by-Step Analysis**:  

1. **Accelerometer Dynamics**:  
   - **x-axis**: The initial stability (4.7–5.3 m/s²) suggests **steady forward motion** (consistent with walking). The mid-period drop to ~3.5 m/s² (samples 40–70, ~4–7s) indicates a **pause or reduced speed** (e.g., stopping briefly to adjust direction). The subsequent recovery to ~5.2 m/s² aligns with **resumed walking**.  
   - **y-axis**: Values near 8–9 m/s² reflect the sensor’s vertical alignment with gravity. Minor dips (e.g., 7.8 m/s² at sample 95) correspond to **torso tilting during steps**, a hallmark of walking.  
   - **z-axis**: Low-amplitude noise (±0.8 m/s²) and lateral spikes (e.g., 0.78 m/s² at sample 70) suggest **side-to-step adjustments**, common in walking but absent in static or vehicular motion.  

2. **Gyroscope Activity**:  
   - **z-axis**: A sharp yaw spike (0.36 rad/s at sample 80, ~8s) followed by oscillations indicates a **controlled turn** mid-walk. This contrasts with running, which would show higher rotational energy, or car motion, which would involve sustained yaw changes.  
   - **x/y-axes**: Minimal roll/pitch variations (except brief spikes) reinforce upright torso posture, inconsistent with car motion (which would have erratic rotations) or running (higher pitch variance).  

3. **Magnetometer Trends**:  
   - **Reorientation during turn**: The x-axis drop (-17 μT to -11 μT) and z-axis rise (19.7–23.8 μT) align with the gyroscope’s yaw spike, confirming a **change in heading direction** relative to Earth’s magnetic field. This is atypical for static or vehicular motion (which would show smoother field changes in a car or no reorientation if still).  

4. **Temporal Segmentation**:  
   - **0–4s**: Stable accelerometer x-axis and low gyroscope activity → **steady walking**.  
   - **4–7s**: Accelerometer x-axis drop (pause) + gyroscope z-axis spike (turn) → **direction change**.  
   - **7–10s**: Accelerometer recovery and gyroscope stabilization → **resumed walking**.  

5. **Eliminating Other Classes**:  
   - **Still**: Excluded due to accelerometer dynamics and turn evidence.  
   - **Run**: Higher x-axis accelerometer variance (>6 m/s²) and gyroscope energy expected.  
   - **Car**: Sustained lateral/jerkier motions, magnetic field instability from engine interference, and lack of step-like y-axis accelerometer patterns.  

**Conclusion**: The combined data—stable gait cycles, mid-activity turn, and vertical alignment—best match **Walking** with a brief pause and directional change.","### Analysis Summary of IMU Sensor Data (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s):

- **y-axis**:  
  - **Consistent decline**: Shifts from **-42 μT** to **-39 μT**, likely due to torso rotation altering the magnetic flux.  

- **z-axis**:  
  - **Gradual increase**: Rises from **19.7 μT** to **23.8 μT**, reinforcing the turn detected in gyroscope z-axis data.

### **Key Observations**:
1. **Activity Phases**:  
   - **Steady motion** (0–4s): Stable accelerometer x/y, low gyroscope activity.  
   - **Pause/turn** (4–7s): Accelerometer x-axis drop, gyroscope z-axis spike, magnetometer reorientation.  
   - **Resumed motion** (7–10s): Accelerometer recovery, gyroscope stabilization.  

2. **Dominant Motion Types**:  
   - **Vertical stability** (y-axis accelerometer).  
   - **Lateral/turning motion** (z-axis gyroscope and magnetometer).  
   - **Forward/backward deceleration and recovery** (x-axis accelerometer).  

3. **Environmental Influence**:

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Data**  
- **Y-axis Dominance**: Sustained high magnitudes (average ~9–12 m/s²) with extreme peaks (e.g., 17.37 m/s²) align with **vertical dynamic acceleration** from running. Gravity (~9.8 m/s²) combines with upward/downward torso motion during foot strikes and push-offs, creating peaks exceeding 15 m/s².  
- **X-axis Spikes**: Irregular forward/backward accelerations (e.g., 6.85, 7.98 m/s²) correlate with **torso lean adjustments** during stride transitions.  
- **Z-axis Oscillations**: Rapid lateral shifts (e.g., -9.07 to 7.63 m/s²) suggest **side-to-side balance corrections** inherent to running mechanics.  

### **2. Gyroscope Data**  
- **Pitch (X-axis)**: Alternating negative/positive rotations (-0.99–0.78 rad/s) reflect **rhythmic forward-backward torso tilting** synchronized with leg movements.  
- **Roll (Y-axis)**: High variability (-0.81–1.11 rad/s) indicates **lateral torso instability** during asymmetrical strides or uneven terrain.  
- **Low Yaw (Z-axis)**: Minimal twisting (-0.61–0.42 rad/s) rules out activities requiring torso rotation (e.g., dancing, twisting exercises).  

### **3. Magnetometer Data**  
- **Stable Y-axis**: Minimal deviation (~-38 µT) confirms the torso remains oriented forward, consistent with **linear motion** (running) rather than full-body turns.  
- **X/Z-axis Fluctuations**: Gradual changes (e.g., x: -16.06 → -6.74 µT, z: -28.00 → -20.07 µT) align with **minor elevation shifts** during running (e.g., uphill/downhill segments).  

### **Key Differentiators from Other Activities**  
- **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitudes (<10 m/s²) and periodic patterns (absent here).  
- **Car**: Smooth lateral/forward accelerations (e.g., braking/turning) without explosive vertical peaks.  
- **Still**: No sustained high-frequency oscillations or rotational dynamics.  

### **Conclusion**  
The combination of **explosive vertical accelerations**, **rhythmic pitch rotations**, and **lateral balance corrections** strongly indicates **running**. The lack of strict periodicity aligns with natural stride variability or terrain changes during a 10-second run.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s Duration)

2. **Rotational Dynamics**:  
   - Gyroscope x/y-axis variability points to **combined pitch and roll motions** (e.g., bending forward while leaning sideways).  

3. **Orientation Stability**:

---

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **high-intensity, multi-directional torso movements** with explosive vertical actions (jumping/bursts), lateral swaying, and rotational tilts. The lack of periodic patterns in accelerometer/gyroscope data suggests **non-repetitive or complex activity** (e.g., martial arts, agility drills) rather than steady-state motions like walking.

1. **Accelerometer Insights (Vertical Dominance + Lateral Dynamics):**  
   - **Y-axis (Vertical):** Sustained baseline (~10–12 m/s²) aligns with gravity, confirming upright posture. Periodic peaks (e.g., **14.7 m/s²** at sample 48, **15.04 m/s²** at sample 83) correlate with vertical motion from steps. The frequency (~1 peak/second) matches a walking cadence (~60 steps/minute).  
   - **X/Z-axes (Forward/Lateral):** Sharp spikes (e.g., **8.4 m/s²** on x-axis at sample 70, **-8.9 m/s²** on z-axis at sample 73) suggest lateral sway and forward propulsion during walking, inconsistent with static activities like *Still* or vehicle motion (*Car*).  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics (Torso Rotations):**  
   - **X/Y-axes (Roll/Pitch):** Oscillatory spikes (e.g., **-0.68 rad/s** on x-axis at sample 33, **0.86 rad/s** on y-axis at sample 67) align with torso rotations during arm swings and posture adjustments in walking.  
   - **Z-axis (Yaw):** Alternating positive/negative phases (e.g., **0.52 rad/s** at sample 84) indicate gradual turns, typical of walking along a curved path rather than abrupt vehicle maneuvers.  

3. **Magnetometer Trends (Directional Variability):**  
   - **Y-axis (Heading):** Gradual decline (**-25.5→-41.4 µT**) reflects sustained directional changes (e.g., walking in an arc). This contrasts with *Car*, where heading shifts would correlate with sharper gyroscope yaw changes.  

4. **Activity Differentiation:**

### **Inferred Activity**
- **Primary Actions**: 
  - **Vigorous locomotion** (running/jogging) with directional changes (Y-axis accel/gyro trends).
  - **Dynamic reorientation** (e.g., turning, lateral shuffling) inferred from gyro Y/X reversals.
  - **Transient high-energy events** (e.g., jump at Z-axis accel dip, stumble at X-axis spike).
- **Secondary Context**:
  - Possible indoor environment (magnetometer noise from structures).
  - Torso-mounted placement explains combined linear/rotational dynamics.

This data likely represents **high-intensity interval training (HIIT)** or **sports maneuvers** (e.g., basketball cuts) with rapid directional changes and explosive movements."

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:  

1. **Accelerometer Dominance in Y-Axis**:  
   - The **y-axis acceleration** peaks at **17.45 m/s²**, far exceeding gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²). This indicates **vigorous forward-backward motion** of the torso, consistent with running. The sustained high values (e.g., ~12–17 m/s² for 20+ samples) align with repeated strides during a sprint.  
   - **Z-axis fluctuations** (-3.94 to 7.51 m/s²) correlate with vertical torso motion during running (e.g., upward push-off and downward impact).  

2. **Gyroscope Activity**:  
   - **Y-axis gyroscope swings** (-1.61 to 1.62 rad/s) suggest **torso rotation** from arm swings and hip movement during running.  
   - **X-axis alternations** (-1.37 to 1.59 rad/s) match periodic forward/backward tilting of the torso during strides.  

3. **Magnetometer Variability**:  
   - Sharp **z-axis magnetometer oscillations** (-11.25 to 7.50 µT) reflect torso rotation and dynamic reorientation during running, inconsistent with the stable magnetic field shifts expected in a car.  

4. **Eliminating Other Activities**:  
   - **Still**: Ruled out due to high acceleration/gyroscope activity.  
   - **Walking**: Acceleration peaks (e.g., 17.45 m/s²) and gyroscope ranges exceed typical walking intensity.  
   - **Car**: Vertical acceleration spikes (e.g., -3.94 m/s² upward force) and torso-twisting gyroscope data are inconsistent with seated car motion, which would show smoother, less dynamic patterns.  

**Conclusion**: The combined evidence—prolonged forward acceleration, vertical oscillation, and rotational dynamics—strongly indicates **running**.","The provided IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) from a torso-mounted smartphone shows **dynamic motion patterns** over 10 seconds. Below is a structured analysis of the trends and key elements:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Analysis**  
**Key Observations**:
- **Magnitude**:  
  - **Y-axis acceleration** dominates (peaking at **17.45 m/s²**), suggesting **vigorous forward/backward torso motion** (e.g., bending, running, or jumping).  
  - **Z-axis** fluctuates between **-3.94 m/s²** (upward force) and **7.51 m/s²** (downward force), indicating vertical movements (e.g., jumps or posture changes).  
  - **X-axis** shows moderate activity (0.23–7.82 m/s²), likely lateral shifts or rotational motion.  

- **Trends**:  
  - **Y-axis** has sustained high values (e.g., samples 30–50: ~12–17 m/s²), suggesting prolonged exertion (e.g., repeated jumps or running).  
  - **Z-axis** alternates between positive and negative peaks (e.g., samples 20–25: -2.75 to 3.14 m/s²), implying rhythmic vertical motion.  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Analysis**  
**Key Observations**:  
- **Rotational Dynamics**:  
  - **Y-axis gyroscope** shows the largest swings (**-1.61 to 1.62 rad/s**), indicating **torso twisting or lateral rotation** (e.g., turning, side bends).  
  - **X-axis** ranges from **-1.37 to 1.59 rad/s** (pitch-like motion), while **Z-axis** is relatively stable (**-0.58 to 0.41 rad/s**), suggesting minimal yaw.  

- **Trends**:  
  - **Y-axis** has abrupt spikes (e.g., sample 70: 1.62 rad/s), likely short bursts of rotational motion.  
  - **X-axis** alternates between positive and negative peaks (e.g., samples 20–30: -0.73 to 0.73 rad/s), hinting at periodic tilting (e.g., leaning forward/backward).  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Analysis**  
**Key Observations**:  
- **Magnetic Field Stability**:  
  - **Y-axis** remains strongly negative (**-49.7 to -45.0 µT**), aligning with Earth’s magnetic field orientation (assuming device alignment).  
  - **X-axis** fluctuates (0.004–9.07 µT), and **Z-axis** varies widely (**-11.25 to 7.50 µT**), reflecting device rotation and dynamic motion disrupting local magnetic fields.  

- **Trends**:  
  - **X-axis** peaks at ~9 µT (samples 50–60), suggesting rapid orientation changes.  
  - **Z-axis** oscillates sharply (e.g., samples 70–80: -11.25 to 6.31 µT), likely due to torso rotations affecting sensor alignment.  

---

### **Activity Inference**  
The combined data suggests **high-intensity, full-body movements** with features:  
1. **Vertical Jumps**: High z-axis acceleration spikes (upward/downward forces).  
2. **Forward-Backward Motion**: Sustained y-axis acceleration peaks (e.g., sprinting or repeated jumps).  
3. **Torso Twisting**: Pronounced y-axis gyroscope activity (e.g., lateral rotations or side bends).  
4. **Device Reorientation**: Magnetometer variability indicates frequent posture changes.  

---

### **Critical Takeaways**  
- **Dominant Motion**: Vertical and forward-backward acceleration with rotational components.  
- **Activity Candidates**: Jumping jacks, burpees, sprinting, or dance-like movements.  
- **Sensor Noise**: Magnetometer data is heavily influenced by motion artifacts, limiting orientation tracking reliability.  

This analysis aligns with activities involving cyclic, high-energy torso motion over short intervals. For precise classification, machine learning models (e.g., CNN/LSTM) trained on similar IMU data would be necessary."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Accelerometer Dominance on Y-Axis**:  
   - The y-axis accelerometer shows **sustained high magnitudes** (avg. ~10 m/s²) with extreme peaks (e.g., **20.42 m/s²**). This is far beyond the typical range for walking (typically <5 m/s²) or ""Still"" activity. Such sustained forward acceleration aligns with **running**, where the torso experiences significant forward propulsion.  
   - The **z-axis accelerometer** oscillates between positive and negative values, with sharp dips (e.g., **-7.98 m/s²**). These correlate with **foot strikes** during running, where ground impacts generate brief downward forces. Walking would exhibit smaller, rhythmic z-axis oscillations.  

2. **Gyroscope Y-Axis Rotational Peaks**:  
   - The y-axis gyroscope (torso rotation around the lateral axis) shows **high rotational velocity** (peak at **2.85 rad/s**). This matches the **torso flexion/extension** and **arm-swing dynamics** of running. In walking, rotational velocity is typically lower (~1–2 rad/s).  
   - Minimal activity on the x/z gyroscope axes rules out significant lateral tilts or turns, further supporting repetitive forward motion.  

3. **Magnetometer Stability vs. Variability**:  
   - The y-axis magnetometer remains **stable and negative** (avg. ~-47 μT), consistent with forward-facing torso orientation during straight-line motion.  
   - Erratic x/z magnetometer values (e.g., **-10.68 μT** to **8.38 μT**) are likely due to **magnetic interference** (e.g., phone movement near metal objects) rather than directional changes, as running often causes dynamic device shifts.  

4. **Temporal Patterns**:  
   - **Frequency of spikes**: Accelerometer x/y spikes and z-axis dips occur **~1–1.5 Hz**, matching the cadence of running (≈2 steps/second, or ≈1 Hz per leg). Walking would show slower oscillations (~0.5–1 Hz).  
   - **Magnitude consistency**: Sustained high y-axis acceleration (no prolonged low periods) excludes ""Car"" activity, which would involve smoother acceleration/deceleration cycles or engine-related vibrations.  

5. **Exclusion of Other Activities**:  
   - **Still**: No sustained high accelerations or rotational peaks.  
   - **Walking**: Lower y-axis acceleration (typically <7 m/s²) and smaller z-axis impacts.  
   - **Car**: Lack of low-frequency vibrations (e.g., engine idle) or abrupt directional changes (e.g., turns/braking).  

### Conclusion:  
The combination of **vigorous y-axis acceleration**, **periodic z-axis impacts**, and **torso rotation** strongly indicates **running**.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

### **1. Eliminating ""Still"" and ""Car""**  
- **Still**: Ruled out due to high-magnitude accelerations (>15 m/s² on y-axis) and gyroscopic fluctuations, inconsistent with stationary postures.  
- **Car**: Unlikely because:  
  - **Accelerometer**: Car motion typically shows lateral (x/z) vibrations and braking/acceleration spikes, but here, y-axis vertical dominance (18.75 m/s²) and rhythmic peaks (~1–2s intervals) suggest **body-propelled motion**, not vehicular.  
  - **Gyroscope**: Minimal yaw rotation (z-axis: -0.54–0.47 rad/s) contradicts steering/turning patterns expected in a car.  

---

### **2. Distinguishing ""Walking"" vs. ""Run""**  
#### **Accelerometer Evidence**  
- **Y-Axis Peaks**: Sustained super-gravity accelerations (up to 18.75 m/s²) indicate **forceful vertical propulsion**, exceeding typical walking (4–12 m/s²) and aligning with running/jumping.  
- **X/Z-Axis Dynamics**: High lateral spikes (x: 7.79 m/s², z: -3.87 m/s²) correlate with **stride impacts** and torso tilt adjustments during running.  
- **Cyclicity**: Peaks every ~1–2s match a running cadence (~2 steps/second), faster than walking (~1 step/second).  

#### **Gyroscope Evidence**  
- **Pitch/Roll Variability**: Y-axis gyro spikes (-1.89 rad/s) correspond to **forward lean** during acceleration, while x-axis roll (-1.56 rad/s) matches arm swing-driven torso rotation during running.  
- **Low Yaw Activity**: Minimal z-axis rotation (-0.54–0.47 rad/s) rules out turning, consistent with straight-line running.  

#### **Magnetometer Consistency**  
- **Planar Reorientation**: X-axis magnetic fluctuations (-19.32 to -3.81 µT) align with rhythmic torso movement in a fixed direction (no heading changes), typical for running.

  - Cyclic peaks (~1–2s) matching running cadence.  
  - Pitch/roll gyro patterns (torso dynamics during strides).  
- **Exclusion of Jumping**: While vertical peaks suggest jumping, the **consistent periodicity** and absence of free-fall signatures (e.g., z-axis near-zero ""weightlessness"" phases) favor running.  

This aligns with **high-intensity running**, likely at a sprint-like pace, given the extreme y-axis forces and rapid cycle repetition.","The provided IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) from a torso-mounted smartphone (10Hz sampling, 10s duration) reveals the following key characteristics:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Analysis**
#### **X-Axis Acceleration**  
- **Dynamic range**: 0.77–7.79 m/s²  
- **Trend**: Frequent high-magnitude spikes (e.g., 7.79 m/s² at ~5.2s), suggesting **sudden forward/backward torso movements** (e.g., jumping, abrupt stops).  
- **Distribution**: Alternating between moderate (2–4 m/s²) and extreme (>6 m/s²) peaks, indicating repetitive high-intensity actions.

#### **Y-Axis Acceleration**  
- **Dominant axis**: Sustained high values (4.08–18.75 m/s²).  
- **Trend**: Prolonged near-gravity (9.8 m/s²) and super-gravity peaks (e.g., 18.75 m/s² at ~7.8s). Likely reflects **vertical oscillations** (e.g., jumping, stair climbing) combined with lateral torso tilts.  

#### **Z-Axis Acceleration**  
- **Range**: -3.87–7.33 m/s²  
- **Trend**: Oscillates between positive and negative values (e.g., -3.87 m/s² at ~4.8s). Suggests **rotational tilts** (e.g., bending forward/backward) or transient free-fall events.  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Analysis**
#### **X/Y-Axis Rotation**  
- **X-axis**: Moderate fluctuations (-1.56–1.15 rad/s). Spikes at ~7.5s (-1.56 rad/s) imply **sudden roll motions** (e.g., torso twisting).  
- **Y-axis**: High variability (-1.89–1.61 rad/s). Sharp negative peaks (e.g., -1.89 rad/s at ~8.5s) indicate **pitch rotations** (e.g., leaning forward).  

#### **Z-Axis Rotation**  
- **Range**: -0.54–0.47 rad/s  
- **Trend**: Minimal rotation about the vertical axis, ruling out significant **yaw movements** (e.g., turning).  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Analysis**
#### **X/Y/Z-Axis Magnetic Field**  
- **X-axis**: Highly variable (-19.32 to -3.81 µT), likely due to **device reorientation** relative to Earth’s magnetic field.  
- **Y-axis**: Consistently strong negative values (-39.75 to -31.69 µT), aligned with Earth’s magnetic field (northern hemisphere).  
- **Z-axis**: Moderate fluctuations (-30.69 to -22.62 µT), reflecting minor heading changes.  

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**  
The data suggests **high-intensity, rhythmic movements** with vertical dominance (e.g., **jumping jacks, burpees, or running**):  
1. **Accelerometer**: Repeated high-G vertical peaks (y-axis) and lateral spikes (x/z-axes).  
2. **Gyroscope**: Torso pitch/roll rotations during motion transitions.  
3. **Magnetometer**: Consistent with a torso-mounted device undergoing planar reorientations.  

---

### **Key Observations**  
- **Temporal patterns**: Peaks occur every ~1–2s (e.g., 5.3s, 7.1s, 8.9s), suggesting cyclic activity (e.g., exercise reps).  
- **Gravity defiance**: Y-axis accelerations exceed 15 m/s², indicating forceful upward propulsion.  
- **Minimal yaw rotation**: Focus on sagittal/coronal plane motions.  

This aligns with **vigorous aerobic exercise** rather than static or slow movements."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **Y-axis (Lateral)**: Sustained high values (10–16 m/s²) dominate, characteristic of vigorous lateral motion. Running involves pronounced arm swings and torso rotation, aligning with these sustained peaks (e.g., **16.65 m/s²** at sample 3, **15.67 m/s²** at sample 45).  
   - **X-axis (Forward/Backward)**: Rhythmic fluctuations (2–6 m/s²) with abrupt spikes (e.g., **9.41 m/s²** at sample 20). These spikes correlate with forceful forward propulsion during running strides.  
   - **Z-axis (Vertical)**: Large positive/negative spikes (e.g., **6.78 m/s²** at sample 50, **-5.57 m/s²** at sample 64) reflect vertical impacts (foot strikes) and upward torso recoil, consistent with running dynamics.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **Y-axis (Pitch)**: High variability (-1.36–1.69 rad/s) indicates repetitive forward-backward torso tilting, a hallmark of hip rotation during running. Peaks (e.g., **1.69 rad/s** at sample 29) match stride-driven pitch changes.  
   - **Z-axis (Yaw)**: Minimal rotation (-0.57–0.41 rad/s) rules out turns, supporting straight-line motion (e.g., running forward).  

3. **Magnetometer Trends**:  
   - **X-axis**: Gradual decline (-24.12 → -3.75 µT) suggests a slow heading change (e.g., slight drift during a running path), not abrupt turns.  
   - **Stable Y/Z axes**: Minor oscillations align with torso stabilization during running, unlike erratic shifts in car motion.  

4. **Activity Differentiation**:  
   - **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitudes (<10 m/s²) and less pronounced gyroscope pitch variability.  
   - **Car**: Smooth, sustained accelerations (e.g., linear braking/acceleration) without rhythmic spikes or vertical impacts.  
   - **Run**: Matches all criteria—high lateral/vertical accelerations, rhythmic pitch changes, and moderate heading drift.  

**Conclusion**: The combined evidence—vigorous lateral/vertical accelerations, cyclic pitch rotation, and gradual heading shifts—strongly indicates **Running**.","The IMU data collected from the torso-mounted smartphone reveals distinct patterns in acceleration, rotation, and magnetic field variations over 10 seconds.

2. **Orientation Dynamics**:  
   - Negative z-axis accelerations and magnetometer shifts suggest torso tilting (e.g., bending forward).

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:  

### **1. Accelerometer Evidence**:  
- **Y-Axis Dominance**: The y-axis accelerations reach **16.82 m/s²**, far exceeding gravitational acceleration (~9.8 m/s²). This indicates **vigorous vertical motion**, characteristic of running, where torso vertical displacement occurs with each stride.  
- **Periodic Peaks**: Sharp, repetitive spikes in **x** and **y axes** (e.g., **8.53 m/s²** in x, **16.82 m/s²** in y) align with the cadence of running steps. Walking would show lower-magnitude, slower oscillations.  
- **Z-Axis Dynamics**: Negative dips (e.g., **-3.84 m/s²**) suggest **forward torso tilt** during acceleration or deceleration phases of running. A car ride would lack such consistent, activity-correlated tilts.  

### **2. Gyroscope Corroboration**:  
- **Y-Axis Rotations**: Peaks at **1.46 rad/s** indicate **side-to-side torso rotation**, common during running as arms swing and the torso twists to counterbalance leg motion.  
- **X-Axis Fluctuations**: Sudden backward tilts (**-1.48 rad/s**) and forward pitches correlate with stride initiation and termination. Car motion would not produce such biomechanically linked rotations.  

### **3. Magnetometer Context**:  
- **X-Axis Reorientation**: A sharp dip to **-19.31 µT** suggests a forward torso lean, consistent with running posture.  
- **Y-Axis Drift**: Gradual magnetic field changes (~-39 to ~-30 µT) imply movement along a curved path (e.g., running on a track or turning), ruling out ""Still"" or ""Car"" (straight-road driving would show steadier headings).  

### **4. Activity Differentiation**:  
- **vs. Walking**: Walking would show lower acceleration magnitudes (typically <5 m/s²) and less pronounced gyroscope rotations. The extreme y-axis accelerations here are incompatible with walking.  
- **vs. Car**: Car motion would involve smoother accelerations (lacking step-periodic spikes) and magnetometer patterns reflecting vehicle turns rather than torso dynamics. The observed torso tilt/rotation and step-like periodicity exclude car motion.  
- **vs. Still**: The dynamic range of all sensors (e.g., y-axis accelerations spanning 3.87–16.82 m/s²) categorically rules out a stationary activity.  

### **5. Temporal Pattern**:  
- **Escalation**: Acceleration magnitudes increase from ~5 m/s² to >16 m/s² in the first half of the data, reflecting a transition from rest to full-speed running.  
- **Sustained Intensity**: Peaks persist for >50 samples (~5 seconds), consistent with continuous running rather than intermittent actions (e.g., HIIT).  

### **Conclusion**:  
The combined sensor data—vertical acceleration dominance, periodic step signatures, torso rotation, and directional drift—strongly indicate **running**. The absence of vehicle-like smoothness or stillness, coupled with biomechanically plausible torso dynamics, confirms this classification.","The IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) collected from the torso over 10 seconds (100 samples) reveals the following trends and key elements:

- **Key Peaks**:  
  - **High y-axis acceleration** (e.g., 16.82) indicates vigorous vertical motion (e.g., jumping, abrupt posture changes).  
  - **Negative z-axis values** suggest forward/backward tilting or rapid deceleration.  

#### **Trend Distributions**:
- **Periodic Spikes**: Sharp peaks in **x** and **y** axes suggest repetitive actions (e.g., steps during running).  
- **Non-Stationarity**: Y-axis acceleration shifts from ~5 m/s² to ~16 m/s², indicating activity escalation (e.g., transitioning from walking to sprinting).

#### **Trend Distributions**:
- **Bursts of Activity**:  
  - Y-axis peaks (e.g., **1.46 rad/s**) correlate with accelerometer spikes, suggesting combined rotational and linear motion (e.g., turning while moving).  
  - Negative x-axis dips (**-1.48 rad/s**) indicate sudden backward tilting.

  - **z-axis**: -30.75 to -20.49 µT (moderate variability)  
- **Orientation Shifts**:  
  - X-axis dip to **-19.31 µT** suggests device reorientation (e.g., torso bending forward).  
  - Y-axis stability implies minimal lateral rotation.  

#### **Trend Distributions**:
- **Gradual Drift**: Slow changes in y-axis (~-39 to ~-30 µT) indicate prolonged directional shifts (e.g., walking in a curved path).  
- **Transient Spikes**: X-axis fluctuations align with accelerometer/gyroscope peaks, reinforcing dynamic motion phases.  

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**
1. **High-Intensity Motion**:  
   - Extreme y-axis accelerations (**>16 m/s²**) and gyroscope y-axis rotations (**1.46 rad/s**) suggest **vigorous vertical movements** (e.g., jumping jacks, sprinting with torso rotation).  
   - Negative z-axis accelerations (**-3.84 m/s²**) imply rapid forward leans or deceleration.  
2. **Rotational Dynamics**:  
   - Combined y-axis gyroscope peaks and magnetometer drift indicate **torso twisting** during motion (e.g., changing direction mid-activity).  
3. **Transition Phases**:  
   - Early data (first 20 samples) shows moderate motion, escalating to peak intensity (~50–70 samples), then stabilizing.  

---

### **Conclusion**
The data reflects **high-intensity, dynamic activity** with vertical motion (jumping/running), torso rotation, and directional changes. Key signatures include:  
- **Y-axis dominance** in acceleration (vertical force) and gyroscope (rotational energy).  
- **Non-gravitational z-axis deviations**, suggesting tilting or abrupt stops.  
- Magnetometer trends confirm reorientation during motion.  

This pattern aligns with activities like **high-intensity interval training (HIIT)**, **sprinting with turns**, or **aerobics**."

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **Y-axis Dominance (4.31–16.91 m/s²)**: Sustained high lateral acceleration (e.g., **16.91 m/s²** at ~4.5s) indicates vigorous side-to-side torso motion. While walking typically shows lower lateral forces, running often involves dynamic arm swings and torso rotations, especially during directional changes or uneven strides.  
- **Z-axis Variability (-4.48–3.77 m/s²)**: Vertical spikes (e.g., **-4.48 m/s²** at ~6.5s) align with foot impacts during running. Gravity-like fluctuations (~1g) are consistent with rhythmic vertical oscillations during a running gait.  
- **X-axis Peaks (0.65–8.11 m/s²)**: Forward/backward jerks (e.g., **8.11 m/s²** at ~3s) match abrupt accelerations/decelerations in running, unlike the smoother transitions in walking.  

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **Y-axis Rotation (-1.18–1.55 rad/s)**: Pronounced twisting (e.g., **1.55 rad/s** at ~2.8s) correlates with torso rotation during running strides. This exceeds typical walking torso motion but aligns with the asymmetrical arm and hip movements of running.  
- **X-axis Spikes (-1.14–0.89 rad/s)**: Forward/backward tilting (e.g., **-1.14 rad/s** at ~0.7s) matches the leaning posture during running initiation or deceleration.  

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **Y-axis Decline (-32.4 → -39.0 µT)**: Gradual heading shift suggests a ~30° directional change over 10s, consistent with running along a curved path (e.g., a track).  
- **Stable Z-axis (-30.0 to -22.6 µT)**: Minimal roll/pitch changes confirm the device remains torso-mounted without drastic reorientation.  

### **Eliminating Alternatives**  
- **Still**: Excluded due to high-energy accelerometer/gyroscope activity.  
- **Walking**: Insufficient intensity (walking rarely exceeds 5 m/s² laterally or vertically).  
- **Car**: Lateral accelerations (16.91 m/s² ≈ 1.7g) exceed typical vehicle dynamics (cars rarely sustain >0.5g laterally). Magnetometer trends also lack the smooth, prolonged turns of driving.  

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **high-intensity, rhythmic motion** with lateral torso rotation, vertical impacts, and gradual directional changes—hallmarks of **running**, likely at a moderate-to-fast pace (~8–12 km/h).","The IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) from a torso-mounted smartphone over 10 seconds (10Hz sampling rate) reveals the following key trends and characteristics:

  - **Z-axis**: -4.48–3.77 m/s²  
    - Negative spikes (e.g., **-4.48 m/s²** at ~6.5s) imply vertical deceleration (e.g., landing from a jump), while positive peaks align with upward motion.

- **Trends**:
  - **Y-axis** shows periodic high-energy bursts (likely repetitive actions like running or jumping).

- **Key Observations**:
  - Gradual **Y-axis** decline (e.g., -32.4 → -39.0 µT) suggests directional changes (e.g., turning 180° over 10s).
  - **Z-axis** stability implies minimal device roll/pitch changes, consistent with torso-mounted placement.

---

### **Activity Inference**
- **Dominant Motion Patterns**:
  1. **High lateral (Y-axis) acceleration** + **Y-axis gyro rotation**: Likely **side-to-side movements** (e.g., agility drills, dancing).
  2. **Vertical (Z-axis) acceleration spikes**: **Jumping** or **stair-climbing**.
  3. **Directional changes** (magnetometer Y-axis trend): Possible **turning** or **pivoting** during motion.

#### **1. Accelerometer Data Trends**
- **Magnitude & Dynamics**:
  - **Y-axis**: Dominates with the largest dynamic range (≈3.56–15.91 m/s²), indicating significant vertical motion (e.g., torso elevation during steps, jumps, or posture changes). Peaks near ~15 m/s² suggest brief high-intensity movements (e.g., jumping or rapid standing).
  - **Z-axis**: Shows sharp negative spikes (e.g., –5.08 m/s² at sample 55, –6.39 m/s² at sample 99), likely reflecting abrupt forward/backward tilts or downward motions (e.g., bending or stumbling).
  - **X-axis**: Moderate range (≈0.028–8.05 m/s²), suggesting lateral shifts or horizontal torso movements (e.g., side steps or twisting).

- **Gravity vs. Motion**:
  - The y-axis baseline (≈7–10 m/s²) exceeds gravity (9.8 m/s²), implying the sensor’s y-axis is partially aligned with gravity during motion. Variations likely combine gravitational tilt and dynamic acceleration.

#### **2. Gyroscope Data Trends**
- **Rotational Activity**:
  - **X-axis**: Spikes at 0.895 rad/s (sample 23) and 1.289 rad/s (sample 54) indicate sudden roll rotations (e.g., torso twisting or lateral bending).
  - **Y-axis**: Peaks at 1.368 rad/s (sample 63) and –1.213 rad/s (sample 45) suggest pitch motions (e.g., forward/backward leans or sit-to-stand transitions).

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Evidence**:  
   - **Y-axis Dominance**: Sustained high amplitudes (peaking at ~20.88 m/s²) indicate vigorous vertical torso motion. Running generates repeated ground impacts, causing pronounced vertical acceleration.  
   - **X/Z Spikes**: Sudden spikes (e.g., 12.81 m/s² in X, -8.47 m/s² in Z) align with forward propulsion and posture adjustments during running strides.  

2. **Gyroscope Evidence**:  
   - **Y-axis Rotation**: High variability (±1.32 rad/s) correlates with torso rotation during arm swings and stride transitions, a hallmark of running mechanics.  
   - **Intermittent X-axis Peaks**: Negative spikes (e.g., -1.19 rad/s) suggest brief forward/backward tilting during acceleration or deceleration.  

3. **Magnetometer Stability**:  
   - Minimal heading changes (stable X/Z magnetic fields) imply forward-linear motion, consistent with running in a straight path rather than vehicular turns or erratic movements.  

4. **Activity Differentiation**:  
   - **Car**: Unlikely due to lack of low-frequency vibrations or sustained lateral acceleration.  
   - **Walking**: Lower vertical acceleration range (typically <10 m/s²) and less rotational gyro energy.  
   - **Still**: Ruled out by high dynamic ranges in all axes.  

**Conclusion**: The combination of sustained vertical acceleration, torso rotation, and linear motion aligns with **running**.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (10Hz, 10 seconds, Torso-Mounted):

  - **Candidate Activities**: Jumping jacks, running (torso bounce), or repeated bending (e.g., lifting objects).
  - **Supporting Evidence**:
    - Sustained high Y-acceleration (~10–20 m/s²) matches repetitive vertical motion.
    - Gyro Y-axis spikes correlate with arm swings or torso twists.
    - Magnetometer stability implies constrained heading changes (forward-backward motion).

- **Intermittent Events**:
  - Sudden X/Z acceleration spikes (e.g., sample 20, 30) may indicate imbalance recovery or abrupt stops.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. **Primary Motion**: Vertical (Y-axis acceleration) and rotational (Y-axis gyro) dominate, suggesting repetitive, cyclic activity.
2. **Device Orientation**: Negative Z-acceleration spikes imply occasional backward tilting (e.g., leaning).
3. **Environmental Stability**: Magnetometer consistency rules out large heading changes (e.g., walking in a straight line vs. spinning).

This data aligns with **high-energy torso movements** such as **exercise routines** (jumping, aerobics) or **manual labor** (lifting, bending). Further analysis (e.g., spectral energy, peak detection) could refine the classification."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Dynamics**:  
   - **Y-axis Dominance**: The y-axis accelerometer shows sustained peaks (10.6–16.46 m/s²), far exceeding gravity (9.8 m/s²), indicating **forward-backward torso motion** from locomotion. Rhythmic spikes align with step cycles.  
   - **Magnitude Comparison**: Walking typically generates accelerations up to ~3g (29.4 m/s²) in dynamic contexts, but torso-mounted sensors register lower magnitudes due to dampened motion. The observed range (3.44–16.46 m/s²) matches **brisk walking** (not running, which would show higher, sharper peaks).  
   - **Z-axis Oscillations**: Negative dips (e.g., -5.36 m/s²) correlate with heel strikes, while positive spikes (e.g., 4.75 m/s²) reflect vertical torso rebound during steps.  

2. **Gyroscope Patterns**:  
   - **Y-axis Variability**: Fluctuations (-0.81–0.90 rad/s) indicate **torso rotation** synchronized with arm swings during walking. Running would show higher angular rates (>1.5 rad/s).  
   - **Intermittent Spikes**: Transient x/z-axis rotations (e.g., x: -0.91 rad/s) suggest balance adjustments or lateral arm movements, consistent with gait.  

3. **Magnetometer Stability**:  
   - **Y-axis Consistency**: A steady ~-40 µT field confirms an upright posture with minimal heading changes, ruling out car motion (which would show erratic orientation shifts).  
   - **Linear Motion**: Minor x/z-axis drifts reflect natural torso sway during walking, not vehicular turns.  

4. **Temporal and Spectral Features**:  
   - **10 Hz Sampling**: Captures ~1–2 steps/sec (brisk walking cadence). Running would require higher sampling rates to resolve faster dynamics.  
   - **Peak Distribution**: Y-axis accelerations lack the sustained >15 m/s² plateaus seen in car acceleration/deceleration.  

**Conclusion**: Rhythmic y-axis accelerations, moderate torso rotations, and stable orientation align with **brisk walking**, not running (too low angular rates) or car motion (no sustained linear acceleration/heading changes).","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Trends and Key Elements

- **Key Evidence:**  
  - Y-axis accelerometer data shows **peaks up to 15.20 m/s²**, significantly exceeding gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s²).  
  - These spikes correlate with forceful upward/downward motion (e.g., foot impacts during running).  
- **Interpretation:**  
  - Walking typically produces vertical accelerations ≤1g (9.8 m/s²).  
  - Running generates higher vertical forces (>1g) due to increased impact during strides, aligning with the observed data.

- **Key Evidence:**  
  - X-axis accelerometer values (1.41 to 8.50 m/s²) show **rhythmic peaks** every ~1 second, matching a running cadence.  
  - This periodicity suggests repetitive forward-backward torso motion (e.g., arm swings or torso lean during running).  
- **Interpretation:**  
  - In walking, horizontal acceleration patterns are less intense and more regular.  
  - Running involves more dynamic upper-body movement, consistent with the semi-regular x-axis spikes.  

### **3. Limited Torso Rotation (Gyroscope)**

- **Interpretation:**  
  - Running in place or forward running maintains a stable torso orientation, unlike jumping jacks, which involve lateral arm/leg motion.  

### **4. Magnetometer Stability**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  - Magnetometer x/y-axes drift gradually but maintain a consistent baseline, suggesting no sharp turns or heading changes.  
- **Interpretation:**  
  - A car ride would show erratic magnetic field changes due to turns or speed variations.  
  - Stable heading aligns with forward running or running in place.

4. **Orientation Stability:**  
   - Magnetometer trends align with a mostly fixed heading (no sharp turns).  

---

### **Likely Activity Classification**  
The data strongly aligns with **jumping jacks** or **high-knee running**:  
- **Jumping jacks:** Vertical acceleration spikes (jumps), lateral arm motion (x/z-axis variance), and minimal rotation.  
- **Running in place:** Vertical impact forces (y-axis), forward-backward torso motion (x-axis), and stable heading.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Evidence (Dynamic Forward Motion & Vertical Impact):**
   - **Y-axis (Forward-Backward):** Sustained high magnitudes (4.23–16.09 m/s²) with peaks exceeding 16 m/s². These values far exceed typical walking thresholds (usually <5 m/s²) and align with running dynamics, where forceful strides generate large forward accelerations. The periodic drops (e.g., 16.09 → 4.23 m/s²) correlate with foot strikes and propulsion phases.
   - **Z-axis (Vertical):** Bipolar spikes (-7.47 to 5.18 m/s²) indicate pronounced vertical oscillations. Negative spikes (upward torso motion) and positive peaks (downward impact) match the rhythmic vertical loading/unloading of running, distinct from the smoother vertical profile of walking or car motion.

2. **Gyroscope Evidence (Torso Dynamics):**
   - **Y-axis (Pitch):** A sharp negative spike (-1.28 rad/s) suggests a rapid forward lean, consistent with accelerating or adapting stride during running. Smaller fluctuations in x/z axes (torso twists/yaw) align with natural arm swings and minor directional adjustments.

3. **Magnetometer Evidence (Directional Change):**
   - **Y-axis Shift:** A ~13 µT reduction indicates a horizontal turn. This matches running scenarios (e.g., navigating a path), as opposed to car turns, which would involve smoother, magnetometer trends due to vehicle dynamics.

4. **Rejection of Alternatives:**
   - **Still:** Ruled out due to sustained high accelerometer activity and magnetometer turn.
   - **Walking:** Insufficient to explain y-axis accelerations >10 m/s² or z-axis spikes approaching 1g.
   - **Car:** Car motion would show smoother accelerometer trends (e.g., sustained y-axis during acceleration) and gyroscopic patterns tied to vehicular maneuvers (e.g., gradual turns), inconsistent with the observed step-driven fluctuations.

**Conclusion:** The combination of high-magnitude forward accelerations (y-axis), vertical impacts (z-axis), and directional turns (magnetometer) strongly supports **Run**. The torso-mounted sensor captures the biomechanical signature of running, including stride-driven forces and dynamic postural adjustments.","**Analysis of IMU Sensor Data from Torso-Mounted Smartphone**

- **x-axis**: Moderate rotations (-1.01 to 1.01 rad/s). Spikes (e.g., 1.01 rad/s at sample 13) hint at **sudden torso twists or bends** (e.g., turning sideways).
- **y-axis**: Largest rotational variation (-1.28 to 0.75 rad/s). A sharp negative spike (-1.28 rad/s) suggests a **rapid downward pitch** (e.g., bending forward).
- **z-axis**: Limited rotation range (-0.55 to 0.49 rad/s). Gradual changes imply subtle yaw motions (e.g., slow turning).

### **3. Magnetometer Data Trends**
- **x-axis**: Steady decline from -17.93 to -14.38 µT, reflecting minor orientation shifts.
- **y-axis**: Significant shift from -40.68 to -27.26 µT, indicating a **~13 µT reduction** likely due to a **90–180° horizontal turn** (e.g., changing direction).
- **z-axis**: Gradual increase (-28.93 to -18.18 µT), aligning with reorientation during motion.

### **Key Observations**
1. **Dominant Motion**: Forward-backward movement (y-axis accelerometer) with periodic vertical adjustments (z-axis accelerometer).
2. **Rotational Activity**: Intermittent torso twists (x-axis gyro) and a sharp forward bend (y-axis gyro spike).
3. **Orientation Change**: Magnetometer y-axis trend confirms a horizontal turn, supported by gyroscopic yaw variations.

### **Activity Hypothesis**
The data suggests **dynamic locomotion with directional changes**, such as:
- **Brisk walking or jogging** (persistent y-axis acceleration).
- **Turning maneuvers** (magnetometer y-axis shift, gyroscopic yaw).
- **Vertical torso movements** (z-axis accelerometer spikes), possibly from stair climbing or uneven terrain.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **Y-Axis (Lateral Acceleration):**  
  - Sustained high magnitudes (peaks up to **15.9 m/s²**) indicate **rhythmic lateral motion**, characteristic of walking with pronounced torso sway or arm swings.  
  - Cyclic fluctuations (~10–15 m/s²) align with step cadence (10Hz sampling over 10s ≈ 100 data points, suggesting ~2 steps/second).  

- **Z-Axis (Vertical Acceleration):**  
  - Sharp **drop to -12.0 m/s²** mid-sequence suggests a **momentary downward motion** (e.g., misstep, tripping, or adjusting footing).  
  - Baseline near gravity (~0–2 m/s²) with oscillations matches vertical torso movement during walking.  

- **X-Axis (Forward Acceleration):**  
  - Moderate baseline (~3–5 m/s²) with sporadic peaks (~9.4 m/s²) aligns with forward propulsion during walking, not sustained enough for running.  

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **Y-Axis (Pitch Rotation):**  
  - Peaks (~±0.8 rad/s) correlate with **forward/backward torso tilts** during stride transitions (e.g., leaning to regain balance after a misstep).  
- **X-Axis (Roll Rotation):**  
  - Spikes (~±0.9 rad/s) suggest **side-to-side torso adjustments**, consistent with lateral sway during walking.  
- **Z-Axis (Yaw):**  
  - Low-magnitude oscillations indicate minimal turning, ruling out car-like rotational dynamics.  

### **3. Magnetometer Correlations**  
- **X/Y/Z Shifts:**  
  - Directional changes align with **torso reorientation** during walking (e.g., facing changes or posture adjustments).  
  - Mid-sequence dip in X-axis magnetometer correlates with the z-axis acceleration drop, supporting a **brief postural deviation** (e.g., stumbling).  

### **4. Eliminating Other Activities**  
- **Still:** Requires minimal acceleration/gyroscope activity, inconsistent with observed peaks.  
- **Run:** Higher-frequency oscillations and sustained forward acceleration (>10 m/s²) expected, not seen here.  
- **Car:** Sustained lateral acceleration (15 m/s²) could imply sharp turns, but lacks corresponding yaw rotation (gyroscope z-axis) or engine vibration patterns.  

### **Conclusion**  
The dominant **cyclic lateral acceleration** (y-axis), **moderate forward/vertical oscillations**, and **torso tilt patterns** strongly indicate **Walking**. The mid-sequence z-axis drop likely reflects a brief stumble or balance adjustment, common in natural gait. Magnetometer shifts further confirm torso reorientation during motion.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s)

3. **Rotational Dynamics:**  
   - **X/Y gyro peaks** → Torso tilting/bending during transitions (e.g., picking up objects, adjusting posture).  

---

### **Key Observations**  
- **Event-Driven Peaks:** Sudden drops/spikes in acceleration (z-axis) suggest discrete actions (e.g., sitting, stumbling).  
- **Cyclic Lateral Motion:** Y-axis acceleration/gyro patterns imply rhythmic activity (e.g., walking with lateral arm swings).  
- **Magnetometer Correlation:** Directional shifts align with torso reorientation during movements.

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Evidence**:  
   - **y-axis (Forward Motion)**: Sustained high values (peaking at ~14.81 m/s²) indicate rapid forward acceleration, characteristic of running. Walking typically shows lower magnitudes (~1–3 m/s²), and ""Car"" would lack rhythmic peaks.  
   - **z-axis (Vertical Impacts)**: Repeated negative dips (e.g., -8.37 m/s²) correlate with foot strikes during running. Such impacts are absent in ""Still"" or ""Car"" scenarios.  
   - **Periodicity**: ~1–2Hz spikes in y/z-axes align with running stride frequency (2 steps/second ≈ 1Hz per leg). Walking strides are slower (~0.5–1Hz).  

2. **Gyroscope Evidence**:  
   - **y-axis (Forward Torso Lean)**: Peaks (e.g., 0.89 rad/s) match torso bending during running to maintain momentum. ""Walking"" would show smaller, smoother rotations.  
   - **z-axis (Directional Changes)**: Alternating left/right turns (-0.50–0.47 rad/s) suggest agility maneuvers (e.g., shuttle runs), ruling out ""Still"" or linear ""Car"" motion.  

3. **Magnetometer Evidence**:  
   - **x-axis (Sharp Orientation Shifts)**: A drop from -52.56 to -6.20 µT implies a ~180° turn, consistent with running drills involving direction changes (e.g., sprints with U-turns).  

4. **Exclusion of Alternatives**:  
   - **Still**: High dynamics (>1.35 m/s² accelerometer, rotational spikes) contradict static posture.  
   - **Walking**: Lower y-axis accelerations (<5 m/s²) and smoother gyroscope trends would be expected.  
   - **Car**: Magnetometer shifts would reflect vehicle turns, but accelerometer z-axis impacts (foot strikes) and rhythmic patterns are absent in seated car motion.  

**Conclusion**: The combined data—high forward/vertical acceleration, stride-aligned periodicity, and directional turns—strongly indicate **running with agility elements** (e.g., shuttle runs or interval training).","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s)

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Dominance in Y-Axis (Forward Motion):**  
   - The y-axis accelerometer shows **sustained high amplitudes (4–15 m/s²)** with peaks at **14.52, 15.25, and 12.51 m/s²**, consistent with vigorous forward-backward torso motion. While walking typically produces lower amplitudes (~2–5 m/s²), running generates higher accelerations due to greater stride force and cadence.  
   - **Irregular periodicity (~2–3 seconds)** suggests variable speed or terrain, aligning with interval running or natural gait variations during sustained running.

2. **Vertical Impacts (Z-Axis Accelerometer):**  
   - Sharp negative dips (e.g., **-8.00 m/s²**) indicate **footstrike forces** during running, where the torso experiences downward acceleration as the body absorbs impact. Positive spikes (e.g., 5.17 m/s²) correlate with upward propulsion phases. These patterns are distinct from Car (smooth vertical noise) or Still (no vertical dynamics).

3. **Gyroscope Signals (Torso Rotation):**  
   - The **y-axis gyroscope spike (-1.55 rad/s)** reflects forward torso lean during acceleration, common in running to maintain momentum.  
   - Moderate **x-axis (roll)** and **z-axis (yaw)** oscillations suggest balance adjustments and directional stability, ruling out Car (rigid torso in seated position) or Still (minimal rotation).

4. **Magnetometer Drift (Orientation Changes):**  
   - Gradual X/Y-axis drifts imply **directional shifts** (e.g., turning while running), unlike Car (sharp turns with magnetometer spikes) or Walking (subtler orientation changes).

5. **Eliminating Other Categories:**  
   - **Still**: Excluded due to high sensor variance.  
   - **Walking**: Lower y-axis accelerations (~2–5 m/s²) and regular periodicity (~1 Hz) mismatch the data.  
   - **Car**: Vertical accelerations in vehicles are smoother, and magnetometer trends would show linear path alignment, not torso-centric multidirectional shifts.

**Conclusion:**  
The combined sensor trends—high forward accelerations, vertical impact forces, and dynamic torso adjustments—align with **running**. Irregular peaks suggest variable intensity (e.g., sprint intervals or uneven terrain), consistent with the described ""highly dynamic activity"" requiring explosive torso motion.","The IMU data from the smartphone on the torso reveals a dynamic activity involving **multidirectional movements** with distinct sensor trends:

### **3. Magnetometer Analysis**
- **X/Y-axis Trends**:  
  - Gradual **drifts in X-axis** (-24 to -10 µT) and **Y-axis fluctuations** (-42 to -31 µT) suggest **orientation changes relative to Earth’s magnetic field**, likely from **turning or pivoting** (e.g., a 180° turn).  
  - **Noise** in Z-axis hints at environmental interference or complex movement patterns.

3. **Gyroscope Pitch Activity (Forward Torso Motion):**  
   - The **Y-axis gyroscope (pitch)** has the **highest variability** (-1.27–0.85 rad/s), reflecting rhythmic forward/backward torso rotations during running. This contrasts with ""Car,"" where pitch variations would be less regular and driven by external forces.  

4. **Magnetometer Trends (Orientation Stability):**  
   - Gradual **magnetometer drifts** (e.g., X-axis from -15.68 to -23.99 µT) suggest **consistent forward motion** without sharp turns (unlike ""Car""). The absence of abrupt magnetic field changes rules out rapid directional shifts.

- **Y-Axis (Forward/Backward Motion):**  
  - **Range:** 3.3–15.5 m/s² (highest dynamic range).  
  - **Trend:** Repeated peaks (e.g., 15.06 m/s² at sample 3, 15.51 m/s² at sample 79) suggest **periodic, high-intensity activity** (e.g., running, jumping). Sustained high values (>10 m/s²) dominate, likely due to torso-forward momentum.  

- **Z-Axis (Vertical Motion):**  
  - **Range:** -5.94–5.67 m/s² (large swings).  
  - **Trend:** Alternating positive/negative spikes (e.g., -5.94 m/s² at sample 41, 5.67 m/s² at sample 81) indicate vertical impacts (e.g., foot strikes during running) or posture changes (e.g., bending).  

#### **2. Gyroscope Data**
- **X-Axis (Roll):**  
  - **Range:** -1.07–1.06 rad/s (moderate rotation).  
  - **Trend:** Occasional sharp rotations (e.g., -1.06 rad/s at sample 12, 1.06 rad/s at sample 61) suggest torso tilting (e.g., leaning sideways).  

- **Y-Axis (Pitch):**  
  - **Range:** -1.27–0.85 rad/s (most dynamic axis).  
  - **Trend:** High variability (e.g., -1.27 rad/s at sample 68, 0.81 rad/s at sample 36) implies frequent forward/backward torso rotations (e.g., bending, lunging).  

- **Z-Axis (Yaw):**  
  - **Range:** -0.77–0.59 rad/s (low-moderate rotation).  
  - **Trend:** Gentle oscillations (e.g., -0.77 rad/s at sample 62) suggest minimal torso twisting.  

#### **3. Magnetometer Data**
- **X/Y/Z Axes (Ambient Magnetic Field):**  
  - **X:** -25.3 to -8.99 µT (large fluctuations).  
  - **Y:** -42.8 to -32.0 µT (strongest field component).  
  - **Z:** -29.8 to -18.3 µT (moderate variability).  
  - **Trend:** Gradual drifts (e.g., X-axis trends from -15.68 to -23.99 µT) correlate with torso orientation changes relative to Earth’s magnetic field.  

---

### **Key Observations**
1. **Activity Type:**  
   - **High-intensity cyclic motion** (e.g., running, jumping jacks) is evident from repeated Y-axis accelerometer peaks (>10 m/s²) and vertical impacts (Z-axis accelerometer).  
   - Torso rotations (pitch/roll) and minimal yaw suggest **forward-focused movement** (e.g., jogging with arm swings affecting torso dynamics).  

2. **Event Highlights:**  
   - **Sample 30–35:** Sudden X/Y acceleration spikes (8.85 m/s², 10.1 m/s²) paired with gyroscope yaw rotation (-0.77 rad/s) may indicate a sharp turn or jump.  
   - **Sample 79–83:** Extreme Y-axis acceleration (15.51 m/s²) and Z-axis magnetometer shift (-26.88 µT) suggest a forceful vertical motion (e.g., jump landing).  

3. **Sensor Noise/Artifacts:**  
   - Magnetometer Z-axis outliers (e.g., -29.8 µT) likely reflect environmental interference rather than motion.  

---

### **Conclusion**
The data corresponds to **vigorous, rhythmic activity** (e.g., running, aerobic exercise) with repetitive forward motion, vertical impacts, and occasional lateral/tilting adjustments. The torso-mounted sensor captures pronounced forward/backward dynamics (Y-axis accelerometer) and rotational pitch (Y-axis gyroscope), while magnetometer trends align with orientation changes during motion."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **y-axis (Forward Motion):**  
  - Peaks up to **15.59 m/s²** (e.g., sample value **15.586793** at t=69) indicate strong rhythmic forward thrusts, consistent with stride cycles.  
  - Semi-periodic oscillations (~1–2 Hz) match the cadence of walking (average 1.5–2 steps/second). Running typically exceeds 2.5 Hz.  
- **z-axis (Vertical Oscillation):**  
  - Bipolar values (**-4.48–4.06 m/s²**) with rhythmic negative dips (e.g., **-4.476226** at t=3) correlate with heel strikes during walking.  
  - Periodicity (~1–2 Hz) reinforces step frequency, distinct from the erratic vertical motion of a car ride.  
- **x-axis (Lateral Motion):**  
  - Sporadic spikes (e.g., **9.13 m/s²** at t=53) suggest occasional torso shifts or arm swings but lack the sustained lateral forces of a car turning.  

### **2. Gyroscope Trends**  
- **y-axis (Pitch):**  
  - Dominant rotations (**-0.85–1.14 rad/s**) align with forward-backward torso tilts during strides (e.g., **1.135565** at t=21). Running often shows higher pitch magnitudes.  
- **x-axis (Roll):**  
  - Intermittent spikes (e.g., **1.047485** at t=32) indicate minor balance adjustments, not the sustained roll of a car maneuvering.  
- **z-axis (Yaw):**  
  - Minimal activity (**-0.45–0.45 rad/s**) confirms no significant turning, ruling out car motion or complex navigation.  

### **3. Magnetometer Drift**  
- **x/y-axis Trends:**  
  - Gradual directional shifts (x: **-24.5 µT → -12.3 µT**; y: **-42.69 µT → -29.56 µT**) suggest slow, consistent forward movement. Cars would exhibit abrupt magnetic changes during turns or stops.  
- **z-axis Stability:** Minor fluctuations (**-29.5 µT → -19.94 µT**) rule out erratic vertical reorientation (e.g., car bumps).  

### **4. Exclusion of Other Activities**  
- **Still:** Contradicted by rhythmic accelerometer/gyroscope activity.  
- **Run:** Y-axis accelerometer peaks (≤15.59 m/s²) and step frequency (~1–2 Hz) are too low for running (typically >3 Hz).  
- **Car:** Lack of sharp turns (low z-axis gyroscope), erratic acceleration, or magnetic anomalies invalidates vehicular motion.  

**Conclusion:** Rhythmic forward/y-axis acceleration, periodic vertical/z-axis oscillations, and torso pitch/y-axis rotations align with **walking** at a steady pace (~1.5–2 steps/second).","### Analysis of IMU Data Trends and Distributions

---

### **Activity Inference**  
The combined sensor trends suggest **walking or light jogging** with:  
1. **Rhythmic forward acceleration** (y-axis accelerometer).  
2. **Vertical oscillation** (z-axis accelerometer) matching step cycles.  
3. **Torso pitch rotations** (y-axis gyroscope) for stride coordination.  
4. **Minor directional adjustments** (magnetometer trends).  

**Notable Features**:  
- No sharp turns (low z-axis gyroscope activity).  
- Lateral accelerometer spikes may correlate with arm swings or device placement shifts.  
- Magnetometer drift suggests slow, consistent movement rather than erratic motion.  

This analysis aligns with **steady-state locomotion** (e.g., treadmill walking or jogging in a straight path)."

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Evidence**  
- **Y-axis (Forward/Backward)**:  
  - **Peaks up to 15.85 m/s²** indicate sustained forward motion. While running often exceeds 20 m/s², these values align with **brisk walking** (e.g., sample 83: 15.85 m/s²).  
  - **Periodicity**: Peaks recur at ~1–2 Hz (e.g., samples 34, 53, 83), matching a walking cadence (~2 steps/second). Running would show faster, higher-magnitude oscillations.  

- **Z-axis (Vertical)**:  
  - **Oscillations (-4.79 to 5.56 m/s²)** correlate with vertical torso motion during steps (e.g., sample 45: -4.79 m/s² downward force during foot strike).  
  - **Step frequency**: Peaks every ~5–7 samples (~0.5–0.7 seconds), consistent with walking (not running’s shorter intervals).  

- **X-axis (Lateral)**:  
  - **Moderate fluctuations (1.21–9.23 m/s²)** suggest slight torso sway or arm swings (e.g., sample 34: 9.23 m/s²), not drastic enough for running or car motion.  

### **2. Gyroscope Evidence**  
- **Y-axis (Tilting)**:  
  - **Sharp negative peaks (-1.13 rad/s)** reflect forward torso tilt during steps (e.g., sample 53: -1.13 rad/s), a hallmark of walking gait. Running would show more aggressive tilting.  

- **X-axis (Twisting)**:  
  - **Spikes (1.25 rad/s)** suggest torso rotation (e.g., sample 53: 1.25 rad/s), likely from arm swings or minor directional adjustments while walking.  

- **Z-axis (Turning)**:  
  - **Moderate yaw (-0.79 to 0.57 rad/s)** indicates gradual turns (e.g., sample 72: 0.57 rad/s), aligning with walking in a changing environment.  

### **3. Magnetometer Evidence**  
- **Y-axis (Directional Shifts)**:  
  - **Large negative swings (-41.74 µT)** correlate with turns (e.g., sample 72: -41.74 µT), likely from walking through a hallway or navigating obstacles.  
  - **Car motion** would show smoother, sustained magnetic field changes during turns.  

- **X-axis (Orientation)**:  
  - **Gradual decline (-26.0 to -9.31 µT)** suggests consistent forward movement with slight heading changes, not abrupt vehicular motion.  

### **4. Ruling Out Other Activities**  
- **Still**: Excluded due to high variability in all axes (e.g., Y-acceleration >15 m/s²).  
- **Run**: Higher acceleration magnitudes (>20 m/s²) and faster step frequency (~3–5 Hz) expected.  
- **Car**: Smoother acceleration profiles (e.g., sustained Y-axis during acceleration/braking) and magnetometer trends (gradual directional shifts) absent.  

### **Conclusion**  
The combined data—periodic Y-axis acceleration (walking cadence), vertical Z-axis oscillations (steps), torso tilting/rotation (gyroscope), and directional shifts (magnetometer)—strongly indicate **Walking**, likely in an environment requiring turns (e.g., indoor navigation).","### Analysis of IMU Sensor Data Trends

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Periodicity (Step Cycles):**  
   - The y-axis (vertical) accelerometer shows **periodic peaks every 1–1.5 seconds** (e.g., 16.22 m/s² at sample 64). This aligns with step cycles but at a higher frequency than typical walking (1.5–2 Hz for running vs. 1–2 Hz for walking).  
   - The **magnitude of peaks** (4.47–16.22 m/s²) exceeds typical walking dynamics (usually <12 m/s²) and matches running’s stronger vertical impacts.  

2. **Torso Pitch (Gyroscope Y-axis):**  
   - The gyroscope’s y-axis (pitch) shows **sharp spikes up to ±1.99 rad/s** (e.g., +1.99 rad/s at sample 15), indicating rapid forward-backward torso tilting. This matches the torso motion during running, where stride impacts cause pronounced pitch oscillations.  

3. **Forward Lean (Accelerometer Z-axis):**  
   - The z-axis accelerometer has **negative dips (e.g., -6.22 m/s²)** and positive spikes (e.g., +10.43 m/s²), reflecting forward torso lean during propulsion and backward motion during foot strikes—a pattern more pronounced in running than walking.  

4. **Lateral Motion (Accelerometer X-axis):**  
   - The x-axis accelerometer shows moderate lateral shifts (1.17–10.14 m/s²), correlating with arm swings or torso rotation during running. These are less rhythmic than walking, consistent with higher-speed motion.  

5. **Magnetometer & Directional Changes:**  
   - Gradual magnetometer y-axis declines (-42.05 µT) suggest heading changes (turning), which can occur during running but are less critical for classification.  

6. **Elimination of Alternatives:**  
   - **Still:** Ruled out due to high dynamics in all axes.  
   - **Car:** Unlikely, as car motion would show sustained directional acceleration (e.g., braking/acceleration in z-axis) without rhythmic step-periodic peaks.  
   - **Walking:** While periodic, the **peak magnitudes (y-axis >16 m/s²)** and **gyroscope pitch spikes (>1.5 rad/s)** exceed typical walking thresholds.  

**Conclusion:**  
The combination of **high-magnitude periodic vertical acceleration**, **rapid torso pitch changes**, and **forward-leaning dynamics** strongly indicates **running**. The 1–1.5s step intervals (6–10 steps in 10s) and intensity of sensor signals align with a running cadence (~6–8 km/h).","The IMU data (10Hz, 10 seconds, torso-mounted) reveals the following key observations across sensors and axes:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Analysis**
#### **Key Features**
- **Y-axis (Vertical):** Dominates with the highest dynamics (4.47–16.22 m/s²). Peaks occur **periodically** (~1–1.5s intervals), suggesting rhythmic vertical motion (e.g., steps during **walking/running**).
- **X-axis (Lateral):** Moderate variations (1.17–10.14 m/s²). Spikes correlate with y-axis peaks, likely lateral torso shifts during movement.
- **Z-axis (Forward/Backward):** Asymmetric range (-6.22 to 10.43 m/s²). Negative dips (e.g., -6.22 at sample 38) may indicate forward torso lean, while positive spikes (10.43 at sample 7) suggest abrupt backward motions.

#### **Trend Distribution**
- **Walking/Running Signature:** Y-axis periodicity aligns with step cycles. Combined x/z-axis variations suggest arm swings or torso rotation.

---

### **2. Gyroscope Analysis**
#### **Key Features**
- **Y-axis (Pitch):** Largest rotational dynamics (-2.0 to +1.99 rad/s). Sharp spikes (e.g., +1.99 rad/s at sample 15) imply rapid forward/backward torso tilting.
- **X-axis (Roll):** Moderate fluctuations (-1.02 to +1.08 rad/s). Negative peaks (e.g., -1.02 at sample 41) suggest lateral tilts.
- **Z-axis (Yaw):** Smaller range (-0.46 to +0.77 rad/s). Gradual shifts (e.g., +0.77 at sample 95) hint at directional changes (turning).

#### **Trend Distribution**
- **Dynamic Motion Phases:** Y-axis spikes correlate with accelerometer y-axis peaks, reinforcing step-related torso pitch. Z-axis trends suggest intermittent turns.

---

### **3. Magnetometer Analysis**
#### **Key Features**
- **Y-axis (Horizontal):** Strongest magnitude (-42.05 to -31.88 µT). Gradual declines (e.g., -42.05 µT at sample 64) imply heading changes.
- **X/Z-axes:** X (-23.88 to -12.31 µT) and Z (-33.76 to -22.63 µT) show less variation but consistent drift, likely due to device reorientation.

#### **Trend Distribution**
- **Orientation Shifts:** Non-periodic, slower variations suggest environmental interference or body rotation (e.g., turning while moving).

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**
- **Primary Activity:** **Walking/Running** with step-driven vertical acceleration (y-axis periodicity) and torso pitch (gyroscope y-axis).
- **Secondary Motions:** 
  - Lateral shifts (x-axis accelerometer) and turns (z-axis gyroscope/magnetometer).
  - Forward leans (z-axis accelerometer negative dips).
- **Outlier Events:** Sudden y-axis acceleration spike (10.14 m/s² at sample 58) and gyroscope y-axis spike (+1.99 rad/s at sample 15) may indicate a stumble or posture correction.

### **Summary of Trends**
| Sensor/Axis      | Key Trend                              | Implied Motion               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Accel Y**       | Periodic peaks (~1–1.5s)               | Step cycles (walking/running)|
| **Gyro Y**        | Spikes during accel peaks              | Torso pitch (step impact)    |
| **Magnet Y**      | Gradual decline                        | Heading change (turning)     |
| **Accel Z**       | Negative dips (forward lean)           | Torso posture adjustment      |
| **Gyro Z**        | Low-magnitude shifts                   | Minor directional changes    |

---

### **Conclusion**
The data strongly suggests **locomotion (walking/running)** with periodic step impacts, torso pitch, and intermittent turns. Sudden spikes may indicate transient events (e.g., tripping, posture shifts). Magnetometer trends support reorientation but are less critical for activity classification compared to accelerometer/gyroscope dynamics."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **y-axis Dominance**: The y-axis (forward/backward) shows sustained high magnitudes (5–15 m/s²), peaking at 15.15 m/s². This is characteristic of **rhythmic bipedal motion** like walking or running. The magnitude aligns more closely with **brisk walking** than running, as running typically exhibits even higher peaks (>20 m/s²).  
   - **z-axis Oscillations**: Vertical acceleration oscillates between -5.21 m/s² and +8.51 m/s². Sharp negative dips (e.g., -3.77 m/s²) correlate with **foot strikes** during walking, while upward peaks correspond to the push-off phase. The range is consistent with walking dynamics.  
   - **x-axis Spikes**: Sporadic lateral spikes (e.g., 10.96 m/s² at sample 10) suggest **arm swings** or **subtle torso tilts** during directional adjustments, common in walking.  

2. **Gyroscope Activity**:  
   - **x-axis Fluctuations**: Rotational spikes (e.g., ±0.99 rad/s) indicate **torso twists** during steps, typical of walking.  
   - **y-axis Spikes**: Brief pitching motions (e.g., 0.96 rad/s at sample 40) align with **forward lean** during stride initiation.  
   - **Low z-axis Magnitude**: Minimal yaw rotation (±0.42 rad/s) rules out erratic turns, supporting steady walking.  

3. **Magnetometer Trends**:  
   - Smooth directional shifts (e.g., x-axis from -18.68 µT to -26.43 µT) indicate **gradual heading changes**, consistent with walking along a curved path rather than abrupt vehicle turns.  

4. **Temporal Consistency**:  
   - The 10-second window contains **periodic cycles** in y/z accelerations (~1–2 Hz), matching a walking cadence (typical step frequency: 1.5–2.5 Hz). Running would show higher frequency (>3 Hz).  
   - Sporadic gyroscope spikes are interspersed with stable intervals, reflecting natural upper-body adjustments during walking.  

5. **Eliminating Alternatives**:  
   - **Still**: Ruled out due to high-magnitude, periodic accelerations.  
   - **Run**: Higher y-axis magnitudes (>15 m/s²) and step frequency expected.  
   - **Car**: Magnetometer would show sharper directional changes, and accelerations would lack bipedal periodicity.  

**Conclusion**: The combined evidence—dominant forward/backward acceleration, cyclical vertical motion, and gradual heading shifts—strongly supports **Walking**, specifically **brisk walking with occasional torso adjustments**.","The IMU data collected from the torso-mounted smartphone reveals distinct patterns in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings, suggesting **dynamic human motion with periodic and sporadic components**.

- **z-axis**:  
  - Oscillates between -5.21 m/s² and +8.51 m/s².  
  - **Sharp negative dips** (e.g., sample 21: -3.77 m/s²) imply vertical deceleration (e.g., landing after a jump), while **peaks** (sample 32: 8.51 m/s²) suggest upward acceleration (e.g., standing up).

  - Suggests **pitching motions** (e.g., bending forward/backward).  

- **z-axis**:  
  - Smaller magnitudes (±0.42 rad/s) with occasional peaks (sample 58: 0.48 rad/s).  
  - Likely **minor yaw rotations** (e.g., subtle directional changes).

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **x-axis**: Gradually shifts from -18.68 µT to -26.43 µT.  
- **y-axis**: Trends downward from -35.57 µT to -27.12 µT.  
- **z-axis**: Stable around -28 µT to -21 µT.  
- **Interpretation**: Smooth directional changes imply **slow turns or orientation adjustments** (e.g., walking in a curved path).  

---

### **Key Observations**  
1. **Activity Type**:  
   - **Periodic acceleration in y/z-axes** and rotational spikes in gyroscopes suggest **walking/running** with occasional **jumps** (z-axis dips).  
   - Sporadic x/y-axis gyro spikes indicate **torso rotations or bends**.  

2. **Intensity**:  
   - High y-axis accelerations (up to 15 m/s²) imply **vigorous motion** (e.g., sprinting or stair climbing).  

3. **Orientation Stability**:  
   - Magnetometer trends confirm **gradual heading changes**, ruling out abrupt spins.

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **a combination of cyclic locomotion (walking/running) and intermittent torso movements** (bending, twisting). The y-axis acceleration dominance and z-axis vertical oscillations are hallmarks of bipedal motion, while gyroscopic spikes correlate with upper-body adjustments. Magnetometer consistency supports controlled directional changes rather than erratic motion. This aligns with activities like **brisk walking in a non-linear path** or **light exercise with torso involvement**."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Dynamics**:  
   - **Y-axis Dominance**: Sustained lateral acceleration peaks (up to **16.3 m/s²**) indicate significant side-to-side torso motion. This aligns with lateral steps or twisting during walking, especially when changing direction.  
   - **X-axis Peaks**: Forward/backward accelerations (up to **10.6 m/s²**) suggest periodic strides, consistent with walking rather than static postures (Still) or vehicle motion (Car).  
   - **Z-axis Modulation**: Gravity-dominated baseline (~9.8 m/s²) with occasional negative spikes (e.g., **-4.66 m/s²**) implies torso tilts or slight lifts during steps, typical of walking mechanics.  

2. **Gyroscope Rotation**:  
   - **Y-axis Spikes**: Angular velocity peaks (**2.12 rad/s**) correlate with torso rotation during directional changes (e.g., turning while walking). This exceeds incidental posture adjustments but is lower than sustained running rotations.  
   - **X/Z-axis Noise**: Minor fluctuations (±1.2 rad/s) suggest balance corrections, aligning with natural arm swings during walking.  

3. **Magnetometer Heading Shift**:  
   - Gradual **X/Y-axis shifts** (e.g., X: **-22.5 → -6.2 µT**) confirm a **~90° heading change** over 10 seconds, consistent with a walking path involving turns (e.g., navigating a corner).  
   - Smooth reorientation rules out erratic vehicle motion (Car) or static orientation (Still).  

4. **Exclusion of Other Activities**:  
   - **Still**: Dynamic accelerations/rotations and heading changes invalidate this.  
   - **Run**: X/Y accelerations (≤16.3 m/s²) and angular velocities (≤2.12 rad/s) are lower than typical running ranges (e.g., >20 m/s² forward acceleration for running).  
   - **Car**: Torso-mounted IMU in a vehicle would show smoother accelerations (e.g., lateral forces during turns) without high-frequency step-related spikes or active torso tilts.  

**Conclusion**: The combined evidence—lateral steps, moderate forward acceleration, heading shifts, and balance-related gyroscope noise—points to **Walking** with directional changes, likely involving turns or a curved path.","### Summary of IMU Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s)

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Y-axis Dominance (Peak ~16.27 m/s²):**  
   - Sustained high-amplitude oscillations on the Y-axis (forward/backward) align with **vigorous torso motion** during running. The torso leans forward during strides, causing repeated acceleration spikes.  
   - Z-axis polarity shifts (-6.95–9.63 m/s²) match vertical forces from foot impacts and upward rebound, characteristic of running.  

2. **Gyroscope Y-axis Activity (Peak ±1.33 rad/s):**  
   - Frequent torso twisting (Y-axis rotations) correlates with arm swings and upper-body adjustments during running. This axis is less active in static (Still) or passive (Car) scenarios.  

3. **Magnetometer Anomaly:**  
   - The X-axis spike (~12.25 µT) likely reflects environmental interference (e.g., phone shifting near metal) rather than activity class. It does not contradict running classification.  

4. **Rejection of Alternatives:**  
   - **Still:** Excluded due to high accelerometer variance and gyroscope activity.  
   - **Walking:** Lower acceleration magnitudes (typically <10 m/s²) and less torso rotation.  
   - **Car:** Magnetometer Y-axis would show stable alignment with Earth’s field; accelerometer trends would lack rhythmic, high-intensity oscillations.  

**Conclusion:** The combined sensor trends—rhythmic high-intensity acceleration, torso rotation, and vertical impacts—strongly indicate **running**.","The IMU data collected from the torso-mounted smartphone over 10 seconds (10 Hz sampling rate) exhibits distinct trends across accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer axes.

1. **Accelerometer Evidence (High-Intensity Vertical Motion):**  
   - The **Y-axis accelerometer** shows sustained high-energy oscillations (peaking at **18.90 m/s²**), characteristic of repetitive, forceful vertical torso movements. Running generates significant vertical acceleration due to the cyclical impact of foot strikes and upward propulsion.  
   - **X-axis** spikes (e.g., **11.62 m/s²**) align with forward/backward torso motion during running strides.  
   - **Z-axis** retains a gravity baseline (~1–2 m/s²) but shows rotational deviations, consistent with torso tilt adjustments during running.  

2. **Gyroscope Evidence (Dynamic Torso Rotation):**  
   - The **Y-axis gyroscope** exhibits sustained oscillations (**-1.75 rad/s** to **1.29 rad/s**), reflecting rhythmic forward/backward torso tilts inherent to running.  
   - **X-axis gyroscope** reversions suggest lateral torso rotations (arm swings counterbalancing leg motion), while the **Z-axis** shows minimal yaw, ruling out turning.  

3. **Magnetometer Evidence (Unconstrained Torso Dynamics):**  
   - **X/Z-axis magnetometer variability** (e.g., **-10.13 µT** to **3.49 µT**) indicates torso orientation changes relative to Earth’s field, consistent with running’s dynamic posture shifts.

4. **Exclusion of Other Activities:**  
   - **Still**: Requires minimal accelerometer/gyroscope activity; inconsistent with high-energy signals.  
   - **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitudes (typically <10 m/s²) and less gyroscopic variability.  
   - **Car**: Magnetometer would show smoother orientation changes (e.g., turns), and accelerometer lacks running’s cyclical vertical peaks.

- **High-Intensity Peaks (x/y-axes):**  
  - X-axis peaks up to **21.12 m/s²** and y-axis up to **43.4 m/s²** exceed gravity, indicating **vigorous forward/backward and lateral motion**. These align with **running dynamics**, where torso movements involve rapid acceleration during strides and arm swings.  
  - **Irregular periodicity** in x-axis (~15–20 m/s²) matches the **asymmetric cadence** of running (e.g., alternating push-off and braking phases).  

- **Vertical Oscillations (z-axis):**  
  - Alternating peaks (up to 8.26 m/s²) and dips (down to -9.54 m/s²) reflect **vertical impacts** from foot strikes during running. The sharp negative dip at ~7 seconds corresponds to a **heel-strike event**, a hallmark of running gait.  

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **Torso Rotations (x/y-axes):**  
  - High angular velocities (x: 3.24 rad/s, y: 3.51 rad/s) indicate **torso rotation and lateral sway** during running. These correlate with arm swings and counter-rotation to maintain balance.  
  - **Burst-like spikes** (e.g., y-axis at ~2.85 rad/s) match the rhythmic yet asymmetric rotation patterns of running, distinct from smoother car motion.

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **Heading Drift (x-axis):**  
  - Gradual x-axis drift (-11.5 to ~3.4 µT) suggests **forward motion along a slightly curved path**, typical of outdoor running.  
  - Stable y-axis (~-45 µT) confirms consistent Earth’s magnetic alignment, ruling out vehicle turns (which would disrupt y-axis more severely).  

- **Tilting (z-axis):**  
  - Upward z-axis trend (6.4 to 20.5 µT) aligns with **leaning forward** during running to maintain momentum.  

### **4. Eliminating Other Activities**  
- **Still:** Excluded due to high variance (σ² > 10 m/s²) and dynamic peaks.  
- **Walking:** Lower acceleration magnitudes (<10 m/s²) and more regular periodicity expected.  
- **Car:** Lateral y-axis accelerations in cars are smoother, and magnetometer y-axis would show abrupt changes during turns. Gyroscope z-axis (yaw) would dominate in vehicles, but here x/y-axes (pitch/roll) are primary.  

### **Conclusion**  
The **high-intensity accelerations**, **torso rotations**, and **vertical impacts** are definitive of **running**. The magnetometer’s gradual heading drift and forward tilt further support sustained, dynamic locomotion rather than vehicular motion or stationary activity.","The provided IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) collected from a torso-mounted smartphone shows **highly dynamic motion** with distinct patterns.

  - **Large spikes** in acceleration (e.g., x-axis up to **21.12 m/s²**, y-axis up to **43.4 m/s²**), far exceeding gravity (9.81 m/s²). These likely correspond to **sudden directional changes** or **vigorous upper-body movements** (e.g., jumping, sprinting, or abrupt stops).  
  - **Periodic fluctuations** in the x-axis (e.g., peaks at ~15–20 m/s²) suggest repetitive motions like **running** or **jumping jacks**.  

- **Z-Axis (Vertical Motion):**  
  - Alternates between **positive** (up to 8.26 m/s²) and **negative** (down to -9.54 m/s²) values, indicating vertical oscillations (e.g., **jumping**, **stomping**, or torso bending).  
  - A sharp **negative dip** (e.g., -9.54 m/s² at ~7 seconds) suggests potential **landing impact** after a jump.

- **Z-Axis (Vertical Orientation):**  
  - **Upward trend** (from ~6.4 to 20.5 µT) suggests the device’s orientation tilting upward (e.g., **leaning forward** during motion).

|-------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| Accelerometer | High dynamic range, vertical impacts  | Non-stationary, sporadic peaks          |

**Analysis:**  
1. **Extreme Accelerometer Peaks**:  
   - The y-axis accelerometer reaches **47.90 m/s²** (~5g), far exceeding forces typical of human motion (e.g., running rarely exceeds 2–3g). Such intense lateral acceleration aligns with **vehicle maneuvers** like sharp turns, rapid lane changes, or sudden braking/acceleration.  
   - The x-axis peaks (**24.12 m/s²**) suggest abrupt forward/backward jerks, consistent with car acceleration/deceleration. Human activities (e.g., running) lack sustained 5g forces.  

2. **Gyroscope Patterns**:  
   - The y-axis gyroscope shows sustained high rotations (**3.35 rad/s**), indicating **pitch motions** (e.g., front/back tilting during braking/acceleration). These correlate with accelerometer spikes, reinforcing vehicle dynamics.  
   - Non-periodic x/y rotational spikes match erratic driving (e.g., swerving) rather than rhythmic human motion (e.g., walking/running).  

3. **Magnetometer Stability**:  
   - The stable y-axis magnetometer (**-49.31 to -45.43 µT**) suggests minimal heading changes, consistent with a car moving in a fixed direction despite lateral accelerations. Human activities (e.g., walking/running) often involve gradual heading shifts.  
   - Z-axis magnetometer spikes (**16.93 µT**) likely reflect metallic interference from the vehicle, not human motion.  

4. **Temporal Characteristics**:  
   - **Bursty, non-rhythmic spikes** in accelerometer/gyroscope data align with irregular vehicle motions (e.g., stop-and-go traffic, potholes) rather than the periodic gait of walking/running.  
   - The torso-mounted sensor’s sustained negative z-axis acceleration (**-12.78 m/s²**) could reflect gravity misalignment due to seat reclining or postural shifts in a car seat.  

**Conclusion**:  
The extreme forces, erratic spikes, and magnetometer anomalies are inconsistent with human biomechanics (Still/Walking/Run). Instead, they strongly correlate with **vehicular motion**, likely aggressive driving or sudden maneuvers in a car.","The IMU data provided captures 10 seconds of human activity sampled at 10Hz (100 samples per axis).

  - **X/Z-axis variability** correlates with rotational motion (e.g., torso twists affecting magnetic alignment).

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**
- **High-intensity movements** dominate:
  - **Accelerometer**: Extreme y-axis peaks (~5g) and x-axis jolts suggest **jumping, sprinting, or impact events** (e.g., falling followed by recovery).
  - **Gyroscope**: Correlated x/y rotational spikes imply **torso twists or rapid postural adjustments** during motion.

   - **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitudes (<20 m/s²) and higher cadence (~2 steps/second) expected.  
   - **Car**: Magnetometer stability could occur on a straight road, but car motion typically lacks the **synchronized torso rotation** and **periodic vertical spikes** seen here.

- **High-Energy Peaks**:  
  - **X-axis**: Peaks up to **18.59 m/s²** (e.g., sample 61) indicate forward propulsion, consistent with running strides.  
  - **Y-axis**: Extreme spikes (e.g., **38.13 m/s²** at sample 12) suggest lateral motion, likely caused by arm swings or torso rotation during running.  
  - **Z-axis**: Negative peaks (e.g., **-11.66 m/s²**) align with vertical impacts from foot strikes, a hallmark of running.  

- **Dynamic Range**:  
  - The **y-axis** range (**-5.07 to +38.13 m/s²**) exceeds typical walking or car motion, ruling out ""Still"" and ""Walking."" Car lateral accelerations rarely reach such extremes without sharp turns, which would not persist for 10 seconds.

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Data**  
- **Y-axis (Forward/Backward)**:  
  - **Extreme Peaks (up to 41.17 m/s²)**: While the 41.17 m/s² spike is likely a sensor artifact, sustained magnitudes of ~20–27 m/s² (2–3g) align with **vigorous torso motion** during running. Forward propulsion during running generates repeated high accelerations as the torso drives forward.  
  - **Periodicity**: The alternation between high peaks (e.g., 25.53, 26.14) and drops suggests rhythmic strides, consistent with running cadence (~2–3 steps/second).  

- **X-axis (Lateral)**:  
  - **Spikes (~15 m/s²)**: Likely caused by arm swings or slight torso rotation during running, which induces lateral forces.  

- **Z-axis (Vertical)**:  
  - **Negative Dips (-12.65 m/s²)**: Correspond to ground impact forces transmitted through the torso during foot strikes, a hallmark of running.  

### **2. Gyroscope Data**  
- **Y-axis (Pitch)**:  
  - **Sustained High Activity (~3 rad/s)**: Indicates repetitive forward-backward torso tilting during running strides. Pitch rotations dominate in running due to the cyclic lean-and-recovery motion.  
- **X-axis (Roll)**:  
  - **Alternating Spikes**: Minor torso twists from arm swings or uneven terrain, but less dominant than pitch.  

### **3. Magnetometer Data**  
- **Stable Y-axis (~-47 µT)**: Confirms the device remains oriented forward (aligned with Earth’s magnetic field), ruling out erratic turns or vehicle maneuvers. This stability matches straight-path running.  

### **Eliminating Other Activities**  
- **Still**: Ruled out due to high accelerometer/gyroscope variability.  
- **Walking**: Lower-intensity accelerations (typically <10 m/s²) and slower cadence (~1–2 Hz) inconsistent with the data.  
- **Car**: Extreme Y-axis accelerations (>20 m/s²) exceed realistic vehicle dynamics (cars rarely exceed 5 m/s²). Gyroscope pitch activity also contradicts passive sitting.  

### **Conclusion**  
The combined data—rhythmic high-intensity accelerations (forward propulsion and impacts), dominant pitch rotations, and stable orientation—strongly indicate **running**. Artifacts (e.g., 41.17 m/s² spike) do not override the overall pattern.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s Duration)

- **Y-axis Rotations**: Peaks in y-axis angular velocity (**±3.4 rad/s**) indicate **steering maneuvers** (e.g., sharp turns or U-turns).  
- **X/Z-axis Support**: Moderate x/z rotations (e.g., **2.2 rad/s in x-axis**) align with minor adjustments (e.g., tilting during turns or uneven terrain).  

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **Directional Shifts**: Gradual z-axis drift (**+2.5 to +19.8 µT**) reflects changes in heading (e.g., navigating curved roads or roundabouts).  
- **Stable Y-axis**: Near-constant y-axis values (**-49.1 to -44.4 µT**) confirm the device’s forward orientation relative to Earth’s magnetic field, typical of a torso-mounted phone in a seated position (e.g., driver/passenger).  

### **Rejecting Other Activities**  
- **Still/Walking/Run**:  
  - No sustained periodicity (ruling out walking/running).  
  - Accelerations exceed human biomechanical limits (e.g., 45 m/s² is ~4.6g, impossible for unaided sprinting).  
  - Magnetometer shifts contradict static postures (Still).  

### **Conclusion**  
The IMU data corresponds to **vehicular motion** (Car), characterized by abrupt accelerations (braking/accelerating), lateral forces (swerving), vertical jolts (road irregularities), and rotational dynamics (steering). The torso-mounted device captures these vehicular-specific inertial and magnetic trends, distinct from human locomotion.","The IMU data from the torso-mounted smartphone reveals a **highly dynamic physical activity** characterized by abrupt accelerations, rotational movements, and orientation changes.

    - Variable ranges (x: **-8.8 to +4.5 µT**, z: **+2.5 to +19.8 µT**), reflecting **orientation changes** (e.g., tilting, turning).

- **Trend Distribution**:
  - **Gradual drifts in x/z**: Slow fluctuations (e.g., z-axis rising from **5.75 to 19.75 µT**) suggest directional shifts (e.g., navigating a curved path).

---

### **Activity Synthesis**
- **Probable Scenario**: 
  - **High-intensity training or sport** with rapid directional changes (e.g., agility drills, basketball, martial arts). 
  - **Key markers**: 
    - Y-axis accelerometer spikes → explosive forward/backward motions.
    - Y-axis gyroscope peaks → torso rotations during direction changes.
    - Magnetometer x/z variability → multi-directional movement.

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Y-axis Dominance (Forward Motion):**  
   - The Y-axis (forward/backward torso motion) shows extreme peaks (up to **25.34 m/s²**), far exceeding typical walking magnitudes (usually <10 m/s²). This aligns with **vigorous linear acceleration** during running, where each stride generates forceful forward propulsion.  
   - Bimodal distribution (peaks at **8–22 m/s²**) suggests alternating phases of acceleration (foot push-off) and deceleration (landing), characteristic of running gait cycles.  

2. **Gyroscope Y-axis Activity (Torso Rotation):**  
   - The Y-axis (pitch/roll) exhibits high-magnitude fluctuations (**-4.7 to 2.9 rad/s**), indicating repetitive torso tilting during running. This matches the forward lean and vertical oscillation of the torso during strides.  
   - Symmetric spread around zero with frequent spikes correlates with rhythmic, cyclic motion rather than irregular movements (e.g., Car turns).  

3. **Magnetometer Stability (Consistent Heading):**  
   - The Y-axis remains near **-47 µT**, reflecting minimal disruption to Earth’s magnetic field. This rules out **Car** (which would show abrupt heading changes).  
   - X/Z-axis variations correlate with gyroscope rotations, confirming torso reorientation during running, not external magnetic interference.  

4. **Exclusion of Other Activities:**  
   - **Still**: High accelerometer/gyroscope variance invalidates inactivity.  
   - **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitudes (<10 m/s²) and smoother gyroscope trends are absent.  
   - **Car**: Lack of sustained lateral acceleration (X-axis) or yaw rotation (gyroscope Z-axis) excludes vehicular motion.  

**Conclusion:** The combined evidence—violent forward acceleration, rhythmic torso rotation, and stable heading—strongly indicates **running**. The outlier Z-axis accelerometer value (-20.41 m/s²) likely reflects transient foot impact or sensor noise, common in high-intensity activities.","### Analysis of IMU Sensor Data Trends

- **Trend Distribution**:  
  - **Non-cyclic shifts** in X/Z axes suggest sporadic reorientation rather than repetitive motion.  
  - Magnetometer noise may reflect interference from dynamic movements rather than true heading changes.  

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**  
The combined data suggests **high-intensity interval training (HIIT)** or **sports maneuvers** (e.g., basketball, soccer):  
1. **Bursts of acceleration** (X/Y/Z) align with explosive movements (jumps, sprints).  
2. **Y-axis gyroscope spikes** match rotational actions (e.g., pivoting, dodging).  
3. **Magnetometer variability** correlates with rapid torso reorientation.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Dominance in Y-Axis (Forward/Backward Motion):**  
   - The **y-axis accelerometer** shows extreme peaks (up to **31.94 m/s²**), far exceeding human-generated motion (e.g., running typically peaks at ~10–15 m/s²). These magnitudes align with **vehicular acceleration/deceleration** (e.g., rapid braking, sharp turns, or acceleration).  
   - **Periodic spikes** (~1–2Hz rhythm) in x/y-axes correlate with **vehicle-specific dynamics** (e.g., gear shifts, road vibrations) rather than human gait.  

2. **Gyroscope Y-Axis (Torso Twisting):**  
   - Large y-axis gyroscope variations (**-3.57 to +3.31 rad/s**) suggest **torso rotation induced by vehicular motion** (e.g., turning corners, lane changes). Human activities like running/walking would show smaller, more rhythmic rotations.  

3. **Magnetometer Stability (Orientation):**  
   - Stable y-axis magnetometer values (**-49.0 to -44.75 µT**) indicate **no full-body rotation** (ruling out activities like dancing or HIIT). X/Z-axis fluctuations align with **torso reorientation during vehicular turns**.  

4. **Vertical Acceleration (Z-Axis):**  
   - Negative dips (e.g., **-9.09 m/s²**) suggest **sudden vertical displacements**, consistent with road irregularities (potholes, speed bumps) rather than human jumps.  

5. **Activity Elimination:**

   - **Walking/Running**: Human motion cannot explain extreme y-axis accelerations (~30 m/s²) or gyroscopic torso twists.  
   - **Car**: Matches all observed patterns (high linear accelerations, rotational shifts from steering, and vertical impacts from road conditions).  

**Conclusion:** The IMU data reflects **vehicular motion** (e.g., driving with frequent acceleration, braking, and turns), not human locomotion.","### Analysis of IMU Sensor Data (Torso-Mounted Smartphone, 10Hz Sampling)  
The sensor data corresponds to **dynamic human motion** with significant linear accelerations, rotational movements, and orientation changes. Below is a breakdown of trends and key elements:

  - **Periodic spikes** (e.g., x-axis peaks at 16–19 m/s² every ~10 samples) suggest **repetitive actions**, potentially steps or rhythmic torso motions.  
  - **Y-axis** shows the strongest acceleration, likely reflecting **forward/backward motion** (e.g., running, lunging).  

- **Z-Axis (Vertical Motion):**  
  - Smaller magnitude compared to x/y (range: **-9.09 to +16.18 m/s²**) but includes gravity (~9.8 m/s²).  
  - Negative dips (e.g., **-9.09 m/s²**) imply **rapid downward motion** (e.g., landing from a jump).  

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Trends**

  - **Largest variations** (range: **-3.57 to +3.31 rad/s**), indicating **torso twisting** (e.g., turning, pivoting).  
  - Sharp reversals (e.g., -2.65 to +2.81 rad/s) suggest **rapid directional changes**.  

- **X/Z-Axes:**  
  - **X-axis**: Moderate fluctuations (**-2.15 to +2.08 rad/s**) hint at lateral tilting.  
  - **Z-axis**: Minimal rotation (**-0.76 to +0.78 rad/s**), ruling out significant spinning.  

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **Orientation Changes:**  
  - **Y-axis (Earth’s magnetic field):** Stable (**-49.0 to -44.75 µT**), typical for torso-mounted devices.  
  - **X/Z-axes**: Fluctuations (x: **-12.05 to -2.08 µT**; z: **3.36 to 16.62 µT**) indicate **torso reorientation** relative to magnetic north (e.g., turning, bending).  

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**  
The combined data suggests a **high-intensity, multidirectional activity** with:  
- **Repetitive horizontal accelerations** (e.g., sprinting, agility drills).  
- **Frequent torso rotations** (e.g., sports like boxing, tennis, or dance).  
- **Vertical impacts** (e.g., jumping, stair climbing).  

---

### **Key Observations**  
1. **Dominant Motion:** Forward/backward acceleration (y-axis) and torso twisting (gyroscope y-axis).  
2. **Periodicity:** ~1–2Hz rhythm in accelerometer x/y (likely steps or cyclic motions).  
3. **Orientation Stability:** Magnetometer y-axis consistency implies minimal full-body rotation (e.g., no 360° turns).  

This aligns with activities like **high-intensity interval training (HIIT)**, **sports drills**, or **dynamic exercise routines**."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Dynamics (Key Indicator of High-Intensity Motion):**  
   - **x/y-axis peaks** (up to +19 m/s² and +27 m/s²) exceed typical walking thresholds (typically <10 m/s² for walking) and align with running dynamics. The torso-mounted sensor captures lateral/vertical forces during stride propulsion and foot strikes.  
   - **z-axis impact spike** (-19.79 m/s²) corresponds to abrupt vertical deceleration, consistent with **foot-ground impact during running**, where peak vertical forces are higher than walking.  
   - **Periodicity**: Peaks every ~1 second (10 samples at 10Hz) suggest a cadence of ~60 strides/minute, which matches moderate running pace (e.g., 6–8 km/h).  

2. **Gyroscope Patterns (Torso Kinematics):**  
   - **Dominant y-axis (pitch) rotation** (peaks up to 4.26 rad/s) reflects rhythmic forward-backward torso tilt during running strides. This contrasts with smaller pitch changes in walking.  
   - **Intermittent x/z-axis fluctuations** correlate with arm swing and minor torso rotation, common in running but less pronounced than in directional changes (e.g., Car turns).  

3. **Magnetometer Stability (Rejects Car Activity):**  
   - **y-axis stability** (-45 to -48 µT) indicates minimal heading changes, ruling out Car (which would show large directional shifts during turns). Gradual z-axis shifts align with torso alignment adjustments during running, not vehicle motion.  

4. **Rejection of Alternative Activities:**  
   - **Still**: Excluded due to high sensor variance.  
   - **Walking**: Accelerometer peaks (x/y >15 m/s²) and gyroscope pitch velocity (>4 rad/s) are too extreme for walking.  
   - **Car**: Magnetometer lacks sustained heading changes, and accelerometer lacks low-frequency vibrations typical of vehicle motion.  

**Conclusion**: The combined high-intensity accelerometer peaks, rhythmic cadence (~1Hz), and torso pitch dynamics align with **running**, distinguishing it from lower-intensity activities (Walking) or non-human motion (Car).","The IMU data from the torso-mounted smartphone exhibits dynamic patterns indicative of **high-intensity, intermittent movements** over 10 seconds.

  - **x/z-axes**: Smaller fluctuations (x: -2 to +2.5 rad/s; z: -0.9 to +0.7 rad/s) suggest minor roll/yaw rotations.  
- **Pattern**: Intermittent bursts align with accelerometer spikes, reinforcing **cyclic, explosive movements** (e.g., jumping combined with torso twists).  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **Orientation Shifts**:  
  - **y-axis**: Stable baseline (-45 to -48 µT) aligns with Earth’s horizontal field, but minor dips suggest **device reorientation** during motion.  
  - **z-axis**: Variability (3–17 µT) implies changes in vertical alignment (e.g., torso bending or jumps altering phone pitch).  

---

### **Activity Inference**  
The combined data suggests **high-intensity interval exercises** with:  
- **Vertical/Lateral Acceleration**: Repeated jumps or explosive movements (e.g., burpees, jump squats).  
- **Torso Rotation**: Rapid pitch changes (y-axis gyro) during landing/takeoff phases.  
- **Impact Forces**: Sudden z-axis acceleration drops correlate with landings.

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **repetitive, full-body movements** involving jumps and torso rotations, characteristic of exercises like **jumping jacks, burpees, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT)**. The torso-mounted sensor captures both dynamic acceleration (jumps) and rotational dynamics (tilting), with magnetometer noise likely from device reorientation during activity."

These values align with vigorous **running**, where foot strikes and upper-body motion generate high-intensity bursts. While running typically has periodic patterns, irregular spikes here may reflect variable stride intensity (e.g., sprinting segments or terrain changes).  
   - **Z-Axis Dips**: Negative values (e.g., -6.24 m/s²) suggest vertical oscillations, consistent with the torso’s vertical motion during running strides.  

2. **Gyroscope Data**:  
   - **Y-Axis Dominance**: Pronounced rotational spikes (up to ~2.9 rad/s) correlate with **torso rotation** during arm swings and upper-body stabilization while running.  
   - **Non-Periodic Spikes**: Irregular y-axis peaks support variable running intensity (e.g., speed changes or uneven pacing).  

3. **Magnetometer Data**:  
   - **Stable Heading (Y-Axis)**: Minimal variation (±5 µT) indicates forward motion without significant directional changes, ruling out **Car** (which would involve turns or swerving).  
   - **Device Rotation (X/Z)**: Small fluctuations align with natural torso tilting during running.  

4. **Elimination of Other Classes**:  
   - **Still**: Excluded due to extreme acceleration/rotation.  
   - **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitudes (~1–3 m/s²) and periodic patterns expected, inconsistent with observed peaks.  
   - **Car**: High lateral (y-axis) accelerations and magnetometer stability could theoretically match aggressive driving, but torso-mounted IMU data would show smoother transitions (e.g., braking/acceleration curves) rather than erratic, human-like spikes.  

**Conclusion**: The combination of high-intensity translational motion (accelerometer), torso rotation (gyroscope), and stable heading (magnetometer) strongly aligns with **Run**, likely involving variable-speed or high-effort sprinting.","The IMU data from the torso-mounted smartphone reveals **dynamic physical activity** characterized by significant variations in acceleration, angular velocity, and orientation. Below is a structured analysis of the trends and key elements:

---

  - **X/Y-axes**: Show extreme dynamic ranges (e.g., x: **-3.0 to +19.3 m/s²**, y: **-5.8 to +23.9 m/s²**), far exceeding gravity (9.8 m/s²). These peaks suggest **vigorous translational motions** (e.g., abrupt starts/stops, jumps, or lateral movements).  
  - **Z-axis**: Relatively smaller range (**-8.3 to +8.4 m/s²**), but inconsistent with static gravity, implying **torso tilting** or vertical oscillations (e.g., jumping).  

#### **Trends**:
- **Intermittent Peaks**: Non-periodic spikes in x/y-axes (e.g., x-axis peaks at 19.27, 15.55, 16.60 m/s²) indicate **bursts of high-intensity movement** (e.g., sprinting, jumping).  
- **Z-axis**: Negative dips (e.g., -6.24, -5.93 m/s²) suggest momentary weightlessness during jumps or descents.  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Data**
#### **Key Observations**:
- **Y-axis Dominance**: Largest angular velocity range (**-2.7 to +2.9 rad/s**), indicating **pronounced rotational motion** around the lateral axis (e.g., torso twisting, side bends).  
- **X/Z-axes**: Moderate activity (x: **-1.9 to +1.7 rad/s**, z: **-1.1 to +0.6 rad/s**), likely stabilizing motions during dynamic activity.  

#### **Trends**:
- **Y-axis Spikes**: Sudden peaks (e.g., 2.92, 2.58 rad/s) correlate with **rapid directional changes** or rotational bursts.  
- **Low-Frequency Oscillations**: Gradual shifts in x/z-axes suggest **continuous rebalancing** during movement.  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Data**
#### **Key Observations**:
- **Y-axis Dominance**: Strongest field component (**-48.5 to -43.0 µT**), aligning with Earth’s magnetic field.  
- **X/Z-axes**: Smaller ranges (x: **-12.2 to -2.9 µT**, z: **+4.1 to +18.1 µT**) reflect **orientation changes** relative to the magnetic north.  

#### **Trends**:
- **Y-axis Stability**: Minimal variation (±5 µT) suggests limited heading changes (e.g., activity confined to a general direction).  
- **X/Z Fluctuations**: Reflect **device rotation** (e.g., torso tilting forward/backward or side-to-side).  

---

### **Activity Synthesis**
#### **Likely Scenario**:
- **High-Intensity Exercise**: Combines **translational bursts** (accelerometer peaks) and **rotational dynamics** (gyroscope y-axis spikes).  
  - Examples: **Jumping jacks**, **burpees**, or **agility drills** with torso twists.  
- **Non-Periodic Nature**: Irregular acceleration/rotation patterns rule out rhythmic motions (e.g., walking/running).  

#### **Key Evidence**:
1. **Acceleration Peaks**: Sudden x/y spikes match explosive movements.  
2. **Y-Axis Rotation**: Dominant torso twisting.  
3. **Z-Acceleration Dips**: Brief weightlessness during jumps.

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Evidence**  
- **X-axis Peaks (22.62 m/s²)**: Exceeds typical walking/jogging thresholds (usually <15 m/s²). These spikes align with **forward propulsion** during running, where torso lean and foot strikes generate high forward acceleration.  
- **Y-axis Extremes (43.23 m/s²)**: Likely sensor artifact or lateral arm swing exaggeration during running. While unusually high, sustained lateral oscillations (baseline -5 to +10 m/s²) suggest rhythmic side-to-side motion, consistent with running gait.  
- **Z-axis Dynamics (-12.60 m/s²)**: Negative dips correlate with **impact phases** (foot strikes), where upward force reduces apparent gravity. Baseline near +9.8 m/s² confirms upright torso orientation, ruling out activities like jumping.  

### **2. Gyroscope Corroboration**  
- **Y-axis Peaks (-4.54 rad/s)**: High pitch rotation matches **forward torso lean** during running initiation and maintenance. Sustained oscillations reflect cyclic stride-driven upper-body motion.  
- **X/Z-axis Moderation**: Limited roll (X) and yaw (Z) rotation exclude complex movements (e.g., twisting in Car), reinforcing forward-focused motion.  

### **3. Magnetometer Context**  
- **Z-axis Variability**: Spikes (e.g., +18.99 µT) suggest minor torso rotation during running but no drastic reorientation (stable Y-axis rules out Car turns).  

### **4. Exclusion of Other Activities**  
- **Still**: Contradicted by extreme accelerations and rotational energy.  
- **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitudes (<10 m/s²) and gyroscope ranges expected.  
- **Car**: Lack of sustained high-frequency vibrations (e.g., engine noise) or magnetometer shifts from turning. Extreme Y-axis spike (43.23 m/s²) is implausible for vehicle dynamics over 10s.  

### **Conclusion**  
The combined accelerometer/gyroscope patterns—high forward/lateral acceleration bursts, impact-driven Z-axis dips, and pitch-dominant rotation—strongly align with **running**. The anomalous Y-axis spike is likely a sensor artifact or exaggerated arm swing, not invalidating the overall running signature.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz Sampling for 10s)

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Evidence**  
- **Magnitude & Patterns**:  
  - **x-axis** peaks up to **+23.4 m/s²** and **y-axis** spikes up to **+38.9 m/s²** exceed typical walking/jogging ranges but align with **high-intensity running** (e.g., sprinting or uphill running). Forward (x) and lateral (y) accelerations suggest vigorous torso motion during leg drive and arm swings.  
  - **z-axis** swings (-15.6 to +20.1 m/s²) correlate with vertical impacts from foot strikes and torso elevation during running strides.  
  - **Non-periodic spikes** (e.g., 23.4 m/s² at ~2.5s) suggest irregular stride intensity, possibly due to terrain changes or sprint initiation.  

### **2. Gyroscope Evidence**  
- **Pitch Dominance (y-axis)**:  
  - **y-axis** peaks (-4.89 to +3.22 rad/s) match torso forward/backward tilts during running. Larger negative spikes (e.g., -4.89 rad/s at ~2.5s) indicate abrupt forward leans, consistent with acceleration phases.  
  - Minimal **yaw (z-axis)** activity rules out turning (e.g., car maneuvers), supporting straight-line motion.  

### **3. Magnetometer Evidence**  
- **Stable y-axis dominance** (-48.06 to -42.61 µT) implies the device remains oriented relative to Earth’s magnetic field, ruling out car turns or reorientation. Noise in x/z axes aligns with motion artifacts from running vibrations.  

### **4. Exclusion of Other Activities**  
- **Still**: Extreme accelerations (>10 m/s²) and gyroscopic activity invalidate this.  
- **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitudes (~2–10 m/s²) and smoother periodic patterns expected.  
- **Car**: Magnetometer stability partially supports this, but extreme y-axis accelerations (38.9 m/s²) and pitch rotations are implausible for vehicle dynamics (cars rarely exceed 5 m/s² laterally).

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Data Interpretation**  
- **Magnitude Analysis**:  
  - **z-axis** peaks at **24.8 m/s²** (2.5× gravity), indicating **forceful vertical motion** (e.g., foot strikes during running).  
  - **y-axis** spikes up to **37.5 m/s²** suggest **lateral body sway** (common in running due to arm swings and torso rotation).  
  - **Periodicity**: Cyclic spikes (~1–2 Hz) in all axes align with running cadence (steps/second).  

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **Rotational Peaks**:  
  - **x-axis** rotations (up to **4.47 rad/s**) correlate with **torso twists** during arm swings.  
  - **y-axis** peaks (**-4.42 rad/s**) match lateral hip motion during stride transitions.  
  - Non-periodic bursts align with natural gait variability in running.  

### **3. Magnetometer Stability**  
- **Orientation**: Stable y-axis (**-48 to -42 µT**) confirms the device remained fixed to the torso without erratic motion, ruling out ""Car"" (which would show abrupt directional changes).  

### **4. Activity Elimination**  
- **Still**: Excluded due to high-magnitude, periodic accelerations.  
- **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitudes (typically <10 m/s²) and smoother rotations compared to observed data.  
- **Car**: Magnetometer stability and lack of sustained forward/backward acceleration (x-axis peaks are intermittent, not vehicle-like) rule this out.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:  

### **1. Accelerometer Analysis**:  
- **Y-axis Peaks**: Extreme accelerations (**>40 m/s²**) dominate, far exceeding typical walking (~1–2 m/s²) or car motion (~0.5–3 m/s²). These spikes align with **vigorous forward propulsion**, consistent with sprinting or rapid strides.  
- **Z-axis Dynamics**: Fluctuations (e.g., **17.30 m/s²** upward, **-6.99 m/s²** downward) suggest vertical motion from **foot impacts** during running, unlike the steadier vertical profile of a car or still activity.  
- **Non-periodic Spikes**: While running often has rhythmic patterns, the irregularity here could reflect **variable stride intensity** or terrain changes (e.g., uphill/downhill segments).  

### **2. Gyroscope Analysis**:  
- **Y-axis Dominance**: Sustained pitch rotations (**-4.21 to 4.27 rad/s**) correlate with **torso leaning forward** during acceleration and upright recovery mid-stride, a hallmark of running mechanics.  
- **X/Z-axis Activity**: Minimal roll/yaw variations rule out car-like steering or lateral shifts, reinforcing forward-focused motion.  

### **3. Magnetometer Analysis**:  
- **Stable Y-axis**: Tight clustering (~**-45 µT**) indicates minimal heading changes, ruling out car turns. This aligns with running in a straight line.  
- **X/Z-axis Variability**: Minor tilting (e.g., torso adjustments during strides) matches running posture shifts.  

### **4. Eliminating Other Activities**:  
- **Still**: No high-magnitude accelerations or rotational dynamics.  
- **Walking**: Lower acceleration peaks (~1–3 m/s²) and smoother gyroscope trends.  
- **Car**: Magnetometer Y-axis would show heading changes during turns, and accelerations rarely exceed 3 m/s² in normal driving. Extreme Y-axis peaks (>40 m/s²) are implausible for car motion.  

### **Conclusion**:  
The combination of **high forward/vertical accelerations**, **pitch-dominated rotations**, and **stable heading** strongly indicates **running**. The extreme Y-axis accelerations may reflect sprinting or uneven terrain, but the overall pattern aligns with the ""Run"" class. Sensor calibration should be verified to exclude artifacts, but the data structurally supports running.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s):

- Gravity dominates the z-axis accelerometer baseline (~9.8 m/s²), but motion artifacts override it during peaks.  
- Magnetometer stability implies minimal environmental interference, making orientation tracking reliable.  
- Gyroscope yaw spikes align with accelerometer peaks, suggesting synchronized dynamic actions.  

This analysis aligns with torso-mounted IMU use cases in fitness tracking or biomechanical studies of explosive movements."

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Y-axis Dynamics**:  
   - The Y-axis (forward/backward) shows **high-magnitude peaks (up to 28.0 m/s²)** with **periodicity every 10–20 samples (1–2 seconds)**, consistent with running cadence. Walking typically has smaller peaks (~10–15 m/s²) and shorter step intervals (0.5–1 second).  
   - Example raw Y-axis data: `28.000015`, `26.462168`, `23.595538` – extreme values exceeding walking thresholds.  

2. **Gyroscope Y-axis Correlation**:  
   - Y-axis gyroscope spikes (e.g., **–5.005 rad/s**, **+2.956 rad/s**) align with accelerometer peaks, indicating **torso rotation during forceful steps** (a running signature). Walking would show smaller, smoother rotations.  

3. **Vertical Motion (Z-axis Accelerometer)**:  
   - Z-axis oscillates between **–10.7 m/s²** (gravity during foot strike) and **+19.9 m/s²** (upward torso motion). Running generates larger vertical forces than walking.  

4. **Magnetometer Stability**:  
   - Y-axis magnetometer remains **stable (~–45 µT)**, confirming motion in a straight line (no turns). This rules out ""Car,"" which would involve heading changes.  

5. **X-axis Adjustments**:  
   - Moderate X-axis accelerometer/gyroscope variations (e.g., `17.3 m/s²` acceleration, `3.8 rad/s` gyroscope) suggest lateral balance shifts during running, not the rhythmic side-to-side motion of walking.  

**Conclusion**: The combination of **high-frequency, high-amplitude Y-axis accelerations**, **torso-rotation spikes in gyroscope**, and **stable heading** decisively indicate **running**. Walking would lack the extreme magnitudes, and ""Still"" or ""Car"" are incompatible with the periodic dynamics.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz Sampling)

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Data (Vertical Dominance):**
   - **Y-axis (Vertical):** Extreme peaks up to **40.4 m/s²** (far exceeding typical walking or running ranges of ~2–20 m/s²). These spikes align with explosive vertical propulsion (e.g., sprinting or rapid acceleration phases during running). The baseline (~15–20 m/s²) also reflects sustained vertical motion.
   - **X/Z-axes:** Moderate lateral (up to 17.1 m/s²) and forward-backward (up to 17.4 m/s²) accelerations, consistent with torso rotation and arm swings during high-speed running.

2. **Gyroscope Data (Pitch Dominance):**
   - **Y-axis (Pitch):** Peaks up to **3.2 rad/s**, indicating repetitive forward-backward torso tilts. This matches the upper-body mechanics of running, where the torso pitches slightly forward to maintain momentum.
   - **X/Z-axes:** Minor roll/yaw fluctuations (<2.6 rad/s), ruling out complex maneuvers (e.g., car turns) or full-body exercises (e.g., burpees).

3. **Magnetometer Data (Stable Heading):**
   - **Y-axis (Magnetic North):** Steady baseline (~-45 μT) with minor fluctuations, confirming the person is moving in a roughly fixed direction (e.g., straight-line running). This eliminates ""Car,"" which would involve frequent heading changes.

4. **Periodicity and Intensity:**
   - **Non-periodic but Repetitive Peaks:** The accelerometer lacks strict periodicity but shows recurring high-energy bursts (every ~1–2 seconds). This aligns with variable stride lengths/intensity in running (e.g., interval training) rather than rhythmic walking or static ""Still"" behavior.
   - **Impact Forces:** Negative z-axis dips (e.g., -9.3 m/s²) correlate with foot strikes during running, distinct from the smoother vibrations of a car.

5. **Eliminating Alternatives:**
   - **Still:** Excluded due to extreme accelerations (>40 m/s²) and rotational activity.
   - **Walking:** Lower accelerations (<10 m/s²) and stronger periodicity expected.
   - **Car:** Magnetometer stability and vertical-dominant acceleration mismatch vehicular motion (lateral/forward forces dominate).

**Conclusion:** The data reflects **high-intensity running** with explosive vertical propulsion, torso pitch adjustments, and impact forces from foot strikes. The extreme y-axis accelerations and gyroscopic pitch activity distinguish it from walking or vehicular motion.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s):

- **Gravity Influence**: Y-axis baseline near **~15–20 m/s²** (higher than 9.8 m/s² due to combined gravity and motion), confirming vertical alignment.

#### **2. Gyroscope Trends**:
- **Rotational Activity**:
  - **Y-axis** (Pitch): Most active (**-3.7 to +3.2 rad/s**), signaling torso **forward/backward bending** (e.g., during squats or jumps).
  - **X-axis** (Roll) and **Z-axis** (Yaw): Smaller fluctuations (**-2.6 to +1.5 rad/s** and **-0.8 to +0.9 rad/s**, respectively), suggesting minor lateral tilts or twists.
- **Peak Events**: Brief y-axis spikes (e.g., +3.2 rad/s) correlate with abrupt torso motions, possibly during transitions (e.g., jumping to prone position).

#### **3. Magnetometer Trends**:
- **Orientation Stability**:
  - **Y-axis** (Magnetic North): Steady baseline (**~-45 μT**), consistent with Earth’s field, but minor dips (e.g., -42.8 μT) imply slight torso rotations.
  - **X/Z-axes**: Moderate variability (**-14 to -5 μT** and **5–20 μT**), reflecting orientation shifts during movement without full turns.

#### **Key Inferences**:
- **Activity Type**: **High-intensity, explosive movements** (e.g., burpees, jump squats) with repetitive vertical accelerations (jumps/landings) and torso pitch rotations (bending).
- **Movement Phases**:
  1. **Propulsion**: Sharp y-axis accelerometer spikes (e.g., 40 m/s²) during jumps.
  2. **Landing/Impact**: Negative z-axis accelerometer dips (e.g., -9.3 m/s²) and gyro y-axis spikes.
  3. **Bending/Recovery**: Gyro y-axis activity aligns with torso pitch changes (e.g., squatting).

#### **Trend Distributions**:
- **Accelerometer**: Non-periodic, high-amplitude peaks (y-axis dominant).
- **Gyroscope**: Semi-periodic y-axis bursts (pitch rotations) with sporadic x/z activity.
- **Magnetometer**: Stable y-axis baseline with minor fluctuations (limited heading changes).

### Conclusion:
The data reflects **high-intensity, full-body exercises** (e.g., burpees or box jumps) with explosive vertical motions and torso bending. The absence of strong periodicity suggests a mix of dynamic, non-repetitive actions typical in interval training."

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **X/Y-axis Dynamics**: The accelerometer X and Y axes show **large, periodic fluctuations** (e.g., X peaks at ~18.6 m/s², Y at ~32.7 m/s²). These magnitudes exceed typical walking (usually <10 m/s²) and align with running, where torso motion generates higher linear acceleration due to stride impacts and arm swings.  
  - **Periodicity**: Peaks recur at ~1.5–2 Hz (e.g., Y-axis: 20.5 m/s² at sample 6, 32.7 m/s² at sample 48). This matches a running cadence (~150–180 steps/minute).  
- **Z-axis**: Vertical spikes (e.g., +21.8 m/s² at sample 12, -17.8 m/s² at sample 50) correlate with ground contact (downward force) and upward propulsion, consistent with running’s vertical oscillation.  

### **2. Gyroscope Insights**  
- **Y-axis Dominance**: The gyroscope Y-axis shows **sustained rotational motion** (±3.0 rad/s), reflecting torso rotation during running strides. This contrasts with walking, where rotations are smaller (±1–2 rad/s).  
- **X-axis Alternations**: Smaller X-axis fluctuations (±2.1 rad/s) suggest lateral balancing motions, typical of running’s asymmetrical gait.  

### **3. Magnetometer Stability**  
- **Fixed Heading**: The magnetometer Y-axis remains stable (-48.6 to -41.8 μT), indicating the user maintained a consistent forward direction. This rules out **Car** (which would involve heading changes during turns) and aligns with straight-path running.  
- **Tilt Noise**: X/Z fluctuations (e.g., Z: +22.2 μT) correlate with torso tilt during stride cycles but do not indicate directional changes.  

### **4. Exclusion of Other Activities**  
- **Still**: Requires minimal accelerometer/gyroscope variations (e.g., all axes <1 m/s², <0.5 rad/s). The data’s high dynamics exclude this.  
- **Walking**: Lower accelerometer magnitudes (~5–10 m/s²) and slower cadence (~1 Hz). The observed 1.5–2 Hz cadence and higher peaks fit running.  
- **Car**: Magnetometer heading would shift during turns, and accelerometer trends would show smoother, vehicle-engine-induced oscillations (e.g., lower frequency, less vertical variation).  

### **Conclusion**  
The combined **high-intensity linear acceleration (X/Y)**, **rotational torso motion (gyroscope Y)**, **vertical oscillation (Z-axis)**, and **stable heading** strongly indicate **Run**. The cadence (~2 Hz) and sensor magnitudes are inconsistent with Walking, Still, or Car.","The IMU data collected from the torso-mounted smartphone exhibits distinct patterns in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings, reflecting dynamic physical activities.

- **Trends**:  
  - **Y-axis**: Sustained negative values (e.g., -3.0 rad/s) suggest prolonged rotational motion (e.g., repeated torso twists).  
  - **X-axis**: Alternating positive/negative peaks hint at lateral swaying or balancing.  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Data**
- **Static vs. Dynamic**:  
  - **Y-axis**: Consistently negative (-48.6 to -41.8 μT), aligning with Earth’s magnetic field (stable orientation relative to north).  
  - **X/Z-axes**: Moderate fluctuations (x: -14.7 to -1.6 μT, z: +3.1 to +22.2 μT), likely due to device tilting during motion.  
- **Trends**:  
  - Sharp dips in **x/z** (e.g., x: -14.7 μT, z: +22.2 μT) correlate with torso reorientations (e.g., bending forward/backward).

  - **High-intensity linear motion** (accelerometer X/Y): Running, brisk walking, or jumping.  
  - **Rotational motion** (gyroscope Y): Torso twists or directional changes.  
  - **Vertical adjustments** (accelerometer Z): Bending, standing, or posture shifts.  
- **Data Distribution**:  
  - **Accelerometer**: Non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed (abrupt movements dominate).  
  - **Gyroscope**: Bimodal distribution (alternating rotational directions).  
  - **Magnetometer**: Stable Y-axis (fixed heading) with tilt-induced noise in X/Z.

### **Conclusion**
The sensor data reflects **dynamic activities combining linear and rotational movements**, such as running with directional changes, aerobic exercises (e.g., jumping jacks), or sports requiring torso engagement (e.g., boxing). The magnetometer’s stable Y-axis confirms the device’s heading remained largely fixed, while accelerometer/gyroscope trends highlight vigorous, multi-axis motion."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Data Indicates High-Intensity Motion**  
- **Y-axis accelerations** show extreme peaks (**37.53 m/s²**) and rapid oscillations (e.g., -4.54 m/s² to 32.85 m/s²). These values far exceed the typical range for walking (~2–3 m/s²) and suggest **vigorous forward/backward motion** consistent with **sprinting** or **rapid directional changes**.  
- **Z-axis accelerations** deviate significantly from gravity (baseline ~9.8 m/s²), ranging from **-10.74 m/s²** to **16.53 m/s²**. This indicates **vertical oscillations** caused by repetitive foot strikes during running, unlike the steadier vertical profile of walking or car motion.  
- **High variance across all axes** (e.g., x-axis spikes up to 17.40 m/s²) rules out ""Still"" or ""Car"" (car motion typically exhibits smoother acceleration trends).  

---

### **2. Gyroscope Data Reveals Torso-Centric Rotation**  
- **Y-axis gyroscope** (range: **-3.61 rad/s** to **3.32 rad/s**) dominates rotational activity, reflecting **torso twisting** during running (e.g., arm swings and upper-body rotation to counterbalance leg motion).  
- **Sporadic x-axis spikes** (e.g., 2.15 rad/s) correlate with abrupt lateral tilts during stride transitions, a hallmark of running dynamics.  
- **Low z-axis rotation** (range: -1.05 rad/s to 0.92 rad/s) indicates minimal yaw motion, ruling out ""Car"" (which would involve sustained yaw during turns).  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Supports Directional Changes**  
- **Z-axis magnetometer** shows a gradual increase from **4.68 µT** to **20.32 µT**, signaling a **heading change**. This aligns with running (e.g., navigating a curved path) but not ""Car"" (car turns would cause sharper, step-like magnetic shifts).  
- **Stable y-axis magnetometer** (values cluster around -47 µT) confirms the device remained fixed to the torso, excluding reorientation artifacts.  

---

### **4. Exclusion of Other Activities**  
- **Still**: Contradicted by high accelerometer/gyroscope variance.  
- **Walking**: Insufficient intensity (walking accelerations rarely exceed 5 m/s²; gyroscope y-axis rotations are weaker).  
- **Car**:  
  - Car motion lacks the **vertical oscillations** seen in z-axis accelerometer data.  
  - Car accelerations are typically smoother (e.g., braking/acceleration events), not the erratic spikes observed here.  
  - Magnetometer z-axis trend in a car would show abrupt shifts during turns, not a gradual rise.

### **Conclusion**  
The combined sensor trends—**high-intensity forward/backward acceleration**, **vertical oscillations**, **torso rotation**, and **gradual heading change**—are definitive markers of **running**. The extreme y-axis accelerometer peaks (>30 m/s²) and correlated gyroscope activity further suggest **sprinting** or **high-speed running**.","The provided IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) from a torso-mounted smartphone exhibits distinct trends and variations, indicative of **dynamic human activity**.

  - **z-axis**: Minimal rotation (**-1.05 rad/s** to **0.92 rad/s**), indicating limited yaw motion.  

**Trend Distribution**:  
- **Y-axis** dominates rotational activity, consistent with **torso-centric movements** (e.g., side-to-side twists).

  - **y-axis**: Strong negative field (**-47.56 µT** to **-43.00 µT**), stable except for a dip to **-43.00 µT** (possible device rotation).  
  - **z-axis**: Gradual increase from **4.68 µT** to **20.32 µT**, indicating **directional changes** relative to Earth’s magnetic field.  

**Trend Distribution**:

   - Likely activities: **Running, jumping, or rapid directional changes**.  
2. **Rotation**:  
   - Prominent **torso twists** (y-axis gyroscope) and lateral tilts (x-axis gyroscope).

| Sensor       | Key Trend                                  | Implied Motion                  |  
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Baseline Stability**:  
   - The y-axis accelerometer (aligned with gravity) remains near-constant (~7.8–8.2 m/s²), confirming an upright torso posture. Minor dips (e.g., ~7.8 m/s² at ~5s) and x/z-axis fluctuations are consistent with subtle vertical/postural adjustments, not rhythmic steps or vehicle motion.  
   - The x-axis transient spike (~5.0 m/s² at ~6s) and z-axis dip (~2.75 m/s² at ~5s) suggest isolated torso movements (e.g., bending or leaning), not continuous locomotion.  

2. **Gyroscope Sporadic Activity**:  
   - Sharp rotational spikes (x: **0.18 rad/s**, y: **0.062 rad/s**, z: **0.045 rad/s**) at ~5s indicate a single dynamic event (e.g., torso twist or bend). These are transient and localized, unlike the periodic rotations seen in walking/running. Post-event, values return to near-zero, ruling out sustained motion.  

3. **Magnetometer Orientation Shifts**:  
   - Magnetometer x-axis variability (e.g., **-4.18 µT** at ~8s) correlates with gyroscope spikes, suggesting a brief orientation change (e.g., torso reorientation). However, y-axis stability (~-18 to -20 µT) confirms no sustained heading change (e.g., turning while walking or driving).  

4. **Activity Differentiation**:  
   - **Walking/Run**: Absent rhythmic accelerometer peaks (e.g., step-induced vertical oscillations) or gyroscope periodicity.  
   - **Car**: No high-frequency vibrations or sustained lateral/forward accelerations typical of vehicle motion.  
   - **Still**: Dominant gravity-aligned accelerometer baseline, isolated motion event (~5s), and minimal post-event fluctuations align with standing still with a brief posture adjustment (e.g., bending to pick an object).  

**Conclusion**: The data reflects a **Still** activity with a transient torso movement at ~5 seconds, inconsistent with cyclic locomotion (walking/run) or vehicular motion.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s)

#### **1. Accelerometer Data**
- **Trends**:
  - **x-axis**: Stable baseline (~4.5–4.9 m/s²) with minor fluctuations. A transient spike (~5.0 m/s²) at ~6 seconds suggests a brief forward/backward motion (e.g., torso lean).
  - **y-axis**: Dominant axis with near-constant values (~7.8–8.2 m/s²), aligning with gravity. Small dips (e.g., ~7.8 m/s² at ~5 seconds) indicate subtle vertical motion (e.g., posture shifts).
  - **z-axis**: Moderate fluctuations (~2.7–3.2 m/s²). A sharp dip (~2.75 m/s²) at ~5 seconds correlates with the y-axis dip, suggesting a combined motion (e.g., bending).
- **Key Insight**: The y-axis dominates due to gravity alignment. The torso likely remained upright with intermittent vertical movements (e.g., walking, posture adjustments).

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Data**
- **Trends**:
  - **x-axis**: Mostly near-zero (±0.03 rad/s) but spiked to **0.18 rad/s** at ~5 seconds, indicating a sudden roll motion (e.g., torso twist or lateral tilt).
  - **y-axis**: Subtle oscillations (±0.02 rad/s) with a spike (**0.062 rad/s**) at ~5 seconds, suggesting a pitch motion (e.g., forward/backward lean).
  - **z-axis**: Minimal rotation (near-zero) except for brief spikes (**0.045 rad/s**) at ~5 seconds, hinting at yaw (e.g., turning).
- **Key Insight**: Rotational activity is sporadic and localized to ~5 seconds, likely a single dynamic movement (e.g., bending, twisting).

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Data**
- **Trends**:
  - **x-axis**: Highly variable (-1.6 to -4.1 µT), with sharp drops (e.g., **-4.18 µT** at ~8 seconds) indicating significant orientation changes relative to Earth’s magnetic field.
  - **y-axis**: Stable baseline (~-18 to -20 µT) with minor deviations, consistent with the torso’s primary heading direction.
  - **z-axis**: Moderate fluctuations (-7.6 to -10.1 µT), reflecting vertical alignment shifts.
- **Key Insight**: Orientation changes correlate with gyroscope spikes (~5 seconds), suggesting a coordinated motion (e.g., turning or tilting).

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**
The data suggests **low-intensity motion** with a **distinct event at ~5 seconds**:
1. **Baseline Activity**: Steady-state upright posture (e.g., standing or slow walking).
2. **Dynamic Event** (~5 seconds): 
   - **Sudden torso twist (roll)** + **forward lean (pitch)** + **orientation shift**, possibly a controlled movement (e.g., picking up an object, adjusting posture).
3. **Post-Event**: Return to baseline with minor fluctuations.

---

### **Technical Notes**
- **Gravity Alignment**: Accelerometer y-axis dominance confirms the device’s vertical orientation.
- **Sensor Noise**: Magnetometer variability is typical for indoor environments (ferromagnetic interference).
- **Sampling Limitations**: 10Hz resolution may miss high-frequency motions but suffices for gross movements.

This analysis aligns with activities like **standing with intermittent torso adjustments** or **slow walking with a brief pause for movement**."

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Evidence**:  
   - The **Y-axis** (gravity-aligned) remains stable (~8 m/s²), indicating an upright posture with minimal vertical displacement. This rules out dynamic activities like walking/running, which would show rhythmic oscillations (e.g., 1–2 Hz cadence for walking).  
   - **X/Z-axes** show minor fluctuations (~0.2–0.5 m/s²) and slow drifts, consistent with subtle torso sway or breathing—not sustained motion. Running or car motion would exhibit larger, periodic accelerations (>2 m/s²).  

2. **Gyroscope Evidence**:  
   - All axes exhibit **low-magnitude rotations** (≤0.28 rad/s). Sporadic Y-axis spikes (~0.25 rad/s) suggest brief torso adjustments (e.g., leaning), but no sustained angular velocity. Walking/running would show rhythmic pelvic rotation (gyroscope Y/Z oscillations ~0.5–1.5 rad/s).  
   - **Z-axis** (yaw) near zero excludes turning or vehicular steering motions.  

3. **Magnetometer Evidence**:  
   - Sharp **magnetometer fluctuations** (e.g., X-axis drops to -4.56 μT) align with environmental interference, not physical motion. Car motion would correlate with smoother heading changes (e.g., gradual Z-axis shifts during turns).  

4. **Temporal Consistency**:  
   - No periodic patterns (e.g., steps in walking) or high-frequency noise (e.g., engine vibrations in a car). Data remains quasi-static for 10 seconds.  

**Conclusion**: The combination of stable gravity alignment, low gyroscopic activity, and environmental magnetometer noise strongly supports **Still** (e.g., standing or seated with minor postural adjustments).","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis

- **Y-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -20.8 to -18.25 μT  
  - **Trend**: Strong negative baseline (~-19 to -20 μT) with periodic dips (e.g., -18.25 μT at sample 50).  
  - **Interpretation**: Earth’s magnetic field dominance; dips suggest torso rotation.  

- **Z-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -9.62 to -7.38 μT  
  - **Trend**: Irregular fluctuations with sharp drops (e.g., -9.62 μT at sample 25).

### **Conclusion**  
The data corresponds to **low-intensity, quasi-static activity** with intermittent torso adjustments. The dominant gravity component (Y-axis accelerometer) and minimal gyroscopic rotation indicate controlled, small-scale movements typical of standing or seated tasks. Magnetometer noise highlights environmental complexity but no drastic heading changes."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **Y-axis Dominance**: The y-axis accelerometer data (7.75–8.1 m/s²) is stable and slightly below gravity (9.8 m/s²), indicating the device is tilted but partially aligned with gravity. This matches torso-mounted phone dynamics during walking, where gravity splits across axes due to posture.  
   - **Lateral Motion (X/Z axes)**:  
     - **X-axis**: Fluctuations (4.5–5.0 m/s²) suggest forward/backward torso sway, typical of step cycles.  
     - **Z-axis**: Spike to **3.22 m/s²** aligns with upward motion during foot strikes.  
   - **Magnitude**: Accelerations lack the sustained high peaks (~10–15 m/s²) expected for *Running* or abrupt changes seen in *Car* motion.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **Pitch/Roll Peaks**:  
     - **Y-axis (pitch)**: Spikes (e.g., **0.117 rad/s**) correlate with rhythmic forward/backward torso tilt during steps.  
     - **X-axis (roll)**: Oscillations (e.g., **0.153 rad/s**) match lateral torso sway during walking.  
   - **Low Yaw (Z-axis)**: Minimal rotation (-0.049 to +0.032 rad/s) rules out turning or vehicular steering.  

3. **Magnetometer Stability**:  
   - **Y-axis Consistency**: Steady values (~-18 to -20 µT) confirm stable heading (no directional changes), supporting straight-line walking.  
   - **No Environmental Noise**: Minor fluctuations in X/Z axes are tied to device tilt, not external interference (e.g., car metal).  

4. **Temporal Rhythmicity**:  
   - **10Hz Sampling**: Data shows periodic peaks in accelerometer (x/z) and gyroscope (x/y) axes every ~10–15 samples (~1–1.5 seconds), matching a walking cadence of ~2–3 steps/second.  

5. **Eliminating Alternatives**:  
   - **Still**: Requires minimal accelerometer/gyroscope variance (not observed).  
   - **Run**: Higher acceleration magnitudes (>8 m/s²) and gyroscope peaks (>0.5 rad/s) absent.  
   - **Car**: Magnetometer would show directional shifts (turns) or smoother accelerations (vehicle dynamics), inconsistent with the data.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:  

### **1. Accelerometer Dynamics**:  
- **Y-axis (Vertical)**: Dominant gravity component (~7–9 m/s²) confirms torso-mounted placement. Minor dips (e.g., 7.37 m/s² at sample 30) align with vertical motion during steps.  
- **X/Z-axes**:  
  - **Z-axis**: Sudden negative spike (−0.75 m/s² at sample 30) and subsequent fluctuations (1–3 m/s²) suggest forward/backward torso tilt during stride transitions.  
  - **X-axis**: Stable baseline with occasional spikes (e.g., 5.95 m/s² at sample 80) indicates lateral shifts during walking.  
- **Pattern**: Periodic variability in X/Z axes matches the cadence of walking, distinct from the steadiness of ""Still"" or sustained high energy of ""Run.""  

### **2. Gyroscope Activity**:  
- **Rotational Bursts**:  
  - **X-axis**: Peaks (0.64 rad/s at sample 30, −0.54 rad/s at sample 35) correlate with torso rotation during arm swings or step initiation.  
  - **Y-axis**: Negative spike (−0.58 rad/s at sample 30) suggests slight forward pitch (leaning during walking).  
- **Magnitude**: Spikes (~0.5–0.6 rad/s) are consistent with walking-related torso adjustments. Running would show higher-amplitude, sustained rotations (>1 rad/s).  

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**:  
- **X-axis Drift**: Steady decline (−2.3 μT to −10.4 μT) indicates gradual heading changes, likely from walking along a curved path or turning.  
- **Z-axis Decrease**: Tilt-induced reorientation (e.g., torso sway) during motion.  
- **Environmental Consistency**: Stable Y-axis (−17 to −20 μT) rules out magnetic interference from vehicles (e.g., ""Car""), which would disrupt all axes.  

### **4. Temporal Patterns**:  
- **Cadence**: Accelerometer/gyroscope spikes occur ~every 20–30 samples (2–3 Hz), matching a walking cadence (~100–120 steps/minute).  
- **Duration**: 10-second window captures repeated cycles, inconsistent with transient ""Still"" or chaotic ""Car"" motion.  

### **5. Exclusion of Alternatives**:  
- **Still**: High accelerometer variability and gyroscope spikes contradict static postures.  
- **Run**: Accelerometer Y-axis would show larger dips (>2 m/s²), and gyroscope peaks would exceed 1 rad/s.  
- **Car**: Magnetometer X/Z axes would show abrupt, non-linear changes during turns, and accelerometer would reflect sustained vehicle acceleration.

- **Y-axis**: Stable around −17 to −20 μT (Earth’s magnetic field horizontal component).  
- **Z-axis**: Gradual decrease from −7.4 μT to −11.2 μT, suggesting device reorientation (e.g., tilt affecting vertical field alignment).  

#### **Trend Distribution**:  
- **Non-Stationary X/Z Axes**: Likely due to user turning or environmental magnetic disturbances (e.g., indoor structures).  
- **Y-axis**: Relatively stable, consistent with Earth’s field dominance.

### **Activity Hypothesis**
1. **Primary Motion**: **Walking or light jogging** with periodic torso rotations (gyroscope spikes).  
2. **Postural Changes**:  
   - Forward/backward bending (Z-axis accelerometer negativity).  
   - Lateral shifts (X-axis accelerometer variability).  
3. **Heading Adjustments**: Magnetometer trends suggest gradual turns or environmental navigation.

### **Conclusion**
The data reflects **moderate-intensity ambulatory activity** (e.g., walking with turns) combined with postural adjustments. The magnetometer’s drift suggests environmental or rotational influences, while gyroscope spikes correlate with directional changes. The torso-mounted placement amplifies gravity-aligned (Y-axis) accelerometer signals, with dynamic motions captured on X/Z axes."

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Evidence:**  
   - **Y-axis (Vertical):** Sustained baseline (7–9 m/s²) with periodic spikes (e.g., **11.37 m/s²**) aligns with vertical oscillations during walking. The spike at sample 53 could represent a forceful step or brief stumble.  
   - **X/Z-axes:** Moderate fluctuations (e.g., X: 3.22–6.83 m/s², Z: 0.48–4.66 m/s²) suggest forward/backward motion and lateral swaying, consistent with natural gait dynamics.  

2. **Gyroscope Evidence:**  
   - **Y-axis (Pitch):** Sustained negative values (**-0.1 to -0.76 rad/s**) indicate a forward-leaning torso posture, typical during walking.  
   - **X-axis (Roll):** Occasional spikes (e.g., **-0.54 rad/s**) suggest balance adjustments (e.g., leaning sideways to stabilize).  

3. **Magnetometer Evidence:**  
   - **X-axis Polarity Shift (-10 → +12 μT):** A **180° heading reversal** confirms the user turned around mid-activity, a plausible action during walking (e.g., changing direction).  
   - **Y-axis Decline (-17 → -35 μT):** Matches gradual reorientation during the turn.  

4. **Exclusion of Other Activities:**  
   - **Still:** Ruled out due to significant motion in all sensors.  
   - **Run:** Accelerometer Y-axis spikes (11.37 m/s²) are lower than typical running thresholds (>12 m/s²). Gyroscope pitch values (-0.76 rad/s) also lack sustained intensity for running.  
   - **Car:** Magnetometer’s directional shift and accelerometer’s gait-like periodicity are inconsistent with vehicular motion (e.g., smoother accelerations, no 180° turns by the torso).  

**Conclusion:** The combined sensor trends (periodic vertical accelerations, directional turn, moderate gyroscope pitch/roll) strongly indicate **Walking** with incidental balance adjustments and a mid-activity turnaround.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis  
The IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) collected over 10 seconds (10 Hz sampling rate) from a torso-mounted smartphone reveals distinct trends and variations. Below is a breakdown of key observations:

---

#### **1. Accelerometer Data Trends**  
**X-axis (Forward/Backward Motion):**  
- **Baseline**: Stable around **4–6 m/s²** with moderate fluctuations.  
- **Outliers**: Sharp drop to **3.22 m/s²** (sample 41) and spike to **6.83 m/s²** (sample 30), indicating sudden backward/forward movements (e.g., stumbling or abrupt stops).  

**Y-axis (Vertical Motion):**  
- **Dominant Trend**: High baseline (**7–9 m/s²**) with a significant spike to **11.37 m/s²** (sample 53).  
- **Implication**: Sustained vertical oscillations (e.g., walking/running) combined with a transient upward jerk (e.g., jumping or torso adjustment).  

**Z-axis (Lateral Motion):**  
- **Dynamic Range**: Lower baseline (**1–4 m/s²**) with a spike to **4.66 m/s²** (sample 62).  
- **Pattern**: Irregular dips (e.g., **0.48 m/s²** at sample 41) suggest lateral swaying or shifts in balance.  

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Data Trends**  
**X-axis (Roll):**  
- **Baseline**: Near-zero with minor fluctuations.  
- **Key Event**: Sudden negative spikes (e.g., **-0.54 rad/s** at sample 46), indicating brief torso rotations (e.g., leaning sideways).  

**Y-axis (Pitch):**  
- **Trend**: Predominantly negative values (**-0.1 to -0.76 rad/s**), reflecting consistent forward/backward tilting (e.g., bending forward or standing upright).  

**Z-axis (Yaw):**  
- **Variability**: Mixed positive/negative values (**-0.27 to 0.18 rad/s**) with no dominant trend, suggesting minimal horizontal turning.  

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Data Trends**  
**X-axis (North-South):**

**Y-axis (East-West):**  
- **Steady Decline**: From **-17 μT** to **-35 μT**, aligning with the torso’s reorientation relative to Earth’s magnetic field.  

**Z-axis (Vertical):**  
- **Noisy Baseline**: Fluctuates between **-10 μT** and **-27 μT**, likely due to interference from nearby metallic objects or dynamic motion.

**Analysis**:  

### **1. Accelerometer Insights**:  
- **y-axis Dominance**: The y-axis (vertical torso alignment) shows sustained high values (6.16–9.62 m/s²), fluctuating near but not fully reaching static gravity (9.8 m/s²). This suggests vertical oscillations *not* caused by repetitive body motion (e.g., walking/running) but likely due to external forces, such as a vehicle’s vertical motion (e.g., driving over uneven terrain or speed bumps).  
- **x/z-axes**: Moderate linear acceleration (x: 4.05–6.43 m/s², z: 0.97–3.37 m/s²) aligns with forward/reverse or lateral vehicle acceleration (e.g., braking, turning). The lack of periodicity rules out human gait.  

### **2. Gyroscope Insights**:  
- **Low-Magnitude Sporadic Peaks**: All axes show minimal angular velocity (-0.28–0.42 rad/s). Brief x-axis bursts (e.g., 0.42 rad/s) correlate with subtle torso shifts during vehicle maneuvers (e.g., lane changes, turns) rather than whole-body rotation. This matches a seated passenger/driver scenario.  

### **3. Magnetometer Insights**:  
- **Gradual x-axis Increase (10.25 → 16.51 µT)**: Indicates a slow, consistent heading change (e.g., a car turning). The y/z-axes remain stable, ruling out significant pitch/roll (e.g., running/walking on slopes).  

### **Key Exclusion of Other Activities**:  
- **Still**: Requires minimal acceleration (~9.8 m/s² on y-axis) and near-zero gyroscope activity. The dynamic y-axis fluctuations and magnetometer trends contradict a static posture.  
- **Walking/Run**: Both demand periodic acceleration patterns (e.g., stride cycles) and higher gyroscope magnitudes (e.g., hip rotation). The data lacks these signatures.  

### **Conclusion**:  
The combined sensor trends—vertical oscillations (accelerometer), gradual heading shifts (magnetometer), and low rotational motion (gyroscope)—align with a **Car** activity. The torso-mounted IMU captures vehicle-induced dynamics (e.g., acceleration, turns) rather than self-propelled motion.","### Summary of IMU Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s):

#### **1. Accelerometer Data**:
- **Main Elements**:  
  - **x-axis**: Moderate linear acceleration (4.05–6.43 m/s²) with minor fluctuations.  
  - **y-axis**: Dominant axis, higher values (6.16–9.62 m/s²), likely aligned with vertical torso motion. Static gravity (~9.8 m/s²) is not fully reflected, suggesting dynamic movement (e.g., bending, lifting).  
  - **z-axis**: Lower values (0.97–3.37 m/s²), indicating lateral/anteroposterior motion with intermittent dips (e.g., postural shifts).  

- **Trend Distribution**:  
  - **y-axis** shows sustained high amplitude with variability, consistent with torso-centric activities (e.g., leaning forward/backward).  
  - **x/z-axes** exhibit smaller oscillations, suggesting stabilization or minor adjustments.  

---

#### **2. Gyroscope Data**:
- **Main Elements**:  
  - **x-axis**: Sparse peaks (e.g., 0.42 rad/s) amid low noise (-0.27–0.18 rad/s), indicating brief rotational bursts (e.g., torso twists).  
  - **y/z-axes**: Minimal fluctuations (-0.28–0.17 rad/s), no sustained rotation.  

- **Trend Distribution**:  
  - Low-magnitude, sporadic angular velocity across all axes. Suggests controlled motion rather than continuous turning (e.g., reaching, adjusting posture).  

---

#### **3. Magnetometer Data**:
- **Main Elements**:  
  - **x-axis**: Gradual increase (10.25 → 16.51 µT), likely due to heading changes.  
  - **y-axis**: Steady negative field (-33.75 → -27.75 µT), aligning with Earth’s magnetic field.  
  - **z-axis**: Fluctuations (-31.0 → -25.2 µT), reflecting orientation shifts.  

- **Trend Distribution**:  
  - **x-axis** trend implies a slow directional change (e.g., turning).  
  - **y/z-axes** show stability with minor deviations, suggesting limited pitch/roll motion.  

---

### **Activity Inference**:
- **Dominant Motion**: Vertical torso movements (y-axis accelerometer) with intermittent rotational bursts (x-axis gyroscope).  
- **Likely Activities**: Dynamic postural adjustments (e.g., bending, controlled twisting) or transitional motions (e.g., standing up, reaching).  
- **Excluded Activities**: Repetitive motions (e.g., walking) or high-intensity actions (e.g., running), due to lack of periodic signals or extreme sensor values.  

### **Key Observations**:
- Gravity misalignment in accelerometer y-axis suggests non-static posture.  
- Magnetometer x-axis trend indicates gradual heading change, possibly during a turn.  
- Low gyroscope magnitudes imply minimal whole-body rotation.  

This analysis aligns with activities involving torso-centric, non-repetitive motions in a dynamic environment."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**  
- **Y-axis (7.2–8.2 m/s²):** Dominated by gravity, confirming an upright torso posture. Small oscillations (e.g., 7.25–8.19 m/s²) align with subtle vertical adjustments during walking.  
- **Z-axis (1.7–3.6 m/s²):** High variability with periodic spikes (e.g., 3.64 m/s²) and drops (1.75 m/s²). These correspond to vertical torso oscillations during steps, a hallmark of walking. Running would show larger magnitudes (>4 m/s²), while ""Still"" or ""Car"" would lack such rhythmic peaks.  
- **X-axis (5.0–6.0 m/s²):** Stable with minor fluctuations, reflecting forward/backward motion without abrupt acceleration (unlike ""Car"" or ""Run"").  

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**  
- **Y-axis (−0.13–0.16 rad/s):** Bidirectional spikes (e.g., −0.132 rad/s to 0.162 rad/s) indicate torso twisting or lateral bending during step transitions. This matches the natural arm swing and torso rotation in walking.  
- **X/Z-axes:** Near-zero rotation (X: −0.1–0.2 rad/s, Z: −0.03–0.03 rad/s). Minimal roll/yaw rules out ""Car"" (steering-induced yaw) or ""Run"" (higher angular motion).  

### **3. Magnetometer Stability**  
- **X-axis (12–15 µT):** Gradual decline suggests slow reorientation (e.g., walking in a slight curve). A ""Car"" would exhibit sharper magnetic field shifts during turns.  
- **Y/Z-axes (−30.0–−27.8 µT):** Stable alignment with Earth’s field, ruling out metallic interference (common in vehicles).  

### **4. Activity Differentiation**  
- **Still:** No periodic z-axis accelerometer spikes or gyroscope variability.  
- **Run:** Higher accelerometer magnitudes (>4 m/s²) and gyroscope activity.  
- **Car:** Smooth accelerometer trends (constant velocity) or sharp turns (magnetometer X-axis jumps).  

### **Conclusion**  
The combination of periodic z-axis acceleration (step rhythm), controlled torso rotation (y-axis gyroscope), stable upright posture, and gradual magnetic reorientation strongly indicates **Walking**.","### Analysis of IMU Sensor Data Trends and Distributions

**Distribution**:  
- **Stable Magnetic Field**: Consistent with minimal environmental interference.  
- **X-axis Drift**: Suggests gradual reorientation (e.g., turning while stationary or walking).  

---

### **Key Inferences**  
1. **Activity Type**: Likely **walking or light ambulation** with periodic vertical motion (z-axis accelerometer spikes) and controlled torso rotation (y-axis gyroscope variations).  
2. **Orientation**:  
   - Upright posture (gravity-dominated y-axis accelerometer).  
   - Minimal heading changes (near-zero z-axis gyroscope).  
3. **Environmental Stability**: Magnetometer consistency implies minimal metallic interference, typical of indoor/outdoor walking.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Analysis**  
   - **X-axis:** The gradual decline (5.52 → 5.29 m/s²) indicates **forward motion** (e.g., torso leaning slightly during steps). The low variability (±0.1 m/s²) rules out abrupt changes seen in *Car* or *Run*.  
   - **Y-axis:** Stable ~7.4 m/s² aligns with gravity (subtracting device tilt), confirming upright posture. Values are too low for *Car* (which would show lateral/forward accelerations >1g) and too stable for *Run* (larger vertical oscillations).  
   - **Z-axis:** Peaks up to 3.46 m/s² reflect **vertical oscillations from steps**. This matches *Walking* (rhythmic up/down torso motion) but lacks the intensity of *Run* (typically >5 m/s²).  

2. **Gyroscope Analysis**  
   - **Y-axis oscillations (-0.04–0.08 rad/s):** Correlate with **hip rotation during walking** (lateral sway). *Run* would show higher angular velocities (>0.2 rad/s), while *Car* might lack rhythmicity.  
   - **X/Z-axes near zero:** Minimal torso roll/yaw, excluding activities like turning (common in *Car*) or dynamic balance shifts (e.g., *Run*).  

3. **Magnetometer Context**  
   - High noise invalidates orientation analysis, but this does not affect activity classification (relies more on accelerometer/gyroscope).  

4. **Temporal Patterns**  
   - **10Hz sampling over 10 seconds** (100 samples) shows **consistent rhythmicity** in accelerometer z-axis and gyroscope y-axis, matching a ~1–2 Hz walking cadence. *Run* would have faster oscillations (~2.5–3 Hz).  

5. **Exclusion of Other Activities**  
   - **Still:** Requires near-zero variability in all axes (contradicted by z-axis accelerometer and y-axis gyroscope trends).  
   - **Car:** Expect irregular accelerometer spikes (braking/turning) and non-rhythmic gyroscope activity.  
   - **Run:** Higher magnitude in accelerometer z-axis (>5 m/s²) and gyroscope y-axis (>0.2 rad/s).  

**Conclusion:** The combined accelerometer/gyroscope trends (rhythmic vertical oscillations, lateral hip sway, and forward drift) are diagnostic of **Walking**.","The provided IMU data from a torso-mounted smartphone exhibits distinct trends across accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer axes. Here's a structured analysis:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Trends**  
**Key Observations:**  
- **X-axis (5.3–5.5 m/s²):** Stable baseline with minor fluctuations (±0.1 m/s²). Slight downward drift over time (e.g., 5.52 → 5.29 m/s²), suggesting subtle forward/backward motion.  
- **Y-axis (7.3–7.5 m/s²):** Near-constant values with minimal variance (±0.07 m/s²). Likely aligned with gravity (torso upright), as values approximate Earth’s gravity (~9.8 m/s²) minus dynamic motion.  
- **Z-axis (3.0–3.4 m/s²):** Moderate variability (±0.3 m/s²). Peaks at ~3.46 m/s² (mid-series) indicate transient vertical motions (e.g., torso adjustments or steps).  

**Inference:** Consistent with steady-state activity (e.g., **walking or light jogging**), where torso motion is rhythmic but constrained. The y-axis dominance aligns with vertical gravity, while x/z variations reflect stride-induced oscillations.

---

### **2. Gyroscope Trends**  
**Key Observations:**  
- **X-axis (-0.09–0.04 rad/s):** Near-zero baseline with sporadic spikes (e.g., -0.089 rad/s at start). Minimal rotational motion, suggesting limited torso roll.  
- **Y-axis (-0.04–0.08 rad/s):** Higher variability, starting positive (0.08 rad/s) and transitioning to oscillations (±0.03 rad/s). Likely reflects lateral sway during motion (e.g., hip rotation in walking).  
- **Z-axis (-0.01–0.03 rad/s):** Tightly clustered near zero. Negligible yaw rotation, indicating forward-facing torso alignment.  

**Inference:** Low rotational energy overall, consistent with **linear locomotion** (e.g., walking). Y-axis oscillations correlate with step-induced hip movement.

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
**Key Observations:**  
- **X-axis (12.4–15.5 µT):** Significant fluctuations (~3 µT range). Likely influenced by environmental interference (e.g., nearby metal objects).  
- **Y-axis (-30.0–-27.1 µT):** Stable negative baseline with minor dips. Reflects Earth’s magnetic field orientation but noisy due to motion artifacts.  
- **Z-axis (-30.8–-28.5 µT):** High variability (~2.3 µT range), suggesting poor calibration or dynamic interference.  

**Inference:** Magnetometer data is **unreliable for orientation tracking** here due to noise and environmental factors. Requires calibration or filtering for meaningful use.

### **Summary of Key Elements**  
1. **Activity Type:** Likely **walking or light jogging** (steady accelerometer baseline, rhythmic gyroscope oscillations).  
2. **Motion Characteristics:**  
   - Linear forward motion (x-axis acceleration drift).  
   - Vertical oscillation (z-axis accelerometer) and lateral sway (y-axis gyroscope).  
   - Minimal torso rotation (low gyroscope magnitudes).  
3. **Sensor Limitations:**  
   - Magnetometer noise limits orientation analysis.  
   - Accelerometer y-axis aligns with gravity (device upright).

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Accelerometer Patterns**  
   - **X-axis** shows a sharp spike (6.07 m/s² at samples 50–70, ~5–7s), exceeding gravity. This matches the **forward propulsion** of a running stride, where torso lean and foot strikes amplify sagittal acceleration.  
   - **Z-axis** oscillations (drop to 2.8 m/s², spikes to 3.8 m/s²) correlate with **vertical impacts** during running, where ground reaction forces induce cyclic loading/unloading.  
   - **Baseline stability** (pre- and post-spike) aligns with transient acceleration phases (start/stop of running).  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**  
   - **Z-axis spike** (0.12 rad/s at 50–60 samples) reflects **torso rotation** during running to maintain balance and stride coordination.  
   - **Y-axis oscillations** (-0.17 to 0.17 rad/s) indicate rhythmic **forward-backward torso tilt** inherent to running mechanics.  
   - Minimal x-axis motion (near-zero roll) rules out erratic movements like jumping or car turns.  

3. **Magnetometer Consistency**  
   - Stable y/z-axis values (-27 to -31 µT) suggest **consistent heading**, excluding car motion (which would show gradual heading shifts). Noise is typical for indoor environments but does not indicate vehicular turns.  

4. **Key Differentiators from Other Activities**  
   - **Walking**: Lower acceleration magnitude (<5.5 m/s²) and less pronounced gyroscope oscillations.  
   - **Car**: Magnetometer would show sustained directional changes; gyroscope z-axis would reflect steering motions.  
   - **Jump**: Isolated vertical spike (z-axis) without rhythmic x/z acceleration patterns.  

**Conclusion**: The combined sagittal acceleration spikes, vertical oscillations, and torso rotation align with **running**, where cyclic strides generate distinct IMU signatures. The torso-mounted sensor amplifies these dynamics compared to limb-mounted placements.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s)

  - **Mid-period spike**: Sharp increase to **6.07 m/s²** (samples 50–70), likely from a **sudden upward/forward torso movement** (e.g., jumping, bending).  
  - Post-spike decay to ~5.5–5.7 m/s² suggests stabilization.  

- **Y-axis**:  
  - Stable around **7.1–7.5 m/s²** (lateral stability).  
  - Minor dip to **7.1 m/s²** (samples 35–45), possibly a brief lateral tilt.  

- **Z-axis**:  
  - Baseline: ~3.0–3.4 m/s² (vertical gravity component).  
  - **Drop to 2.8 m/s²** (samples 35–40) and subsequent spikes (e.g., 3.8 m/s² at sample 38) indicate **vertical oscillations** (e.g., steps or jumps).

#### **2. Gyroscope Trends**  
- **X-axis**:  
  - Mostly near-zero (minimal roll motion).  
  - **Spike at samples 45–50** (0.14 rad/s), suggesting a brief **torso twist or imbalance**.  

- **Y-axis**:  
  - Oscillates between **-0.17 to 0.17 rad/s** (pitch variations).  
  - Large negative dip (**-0.17 rad/s** at sample 30) and positive spike (**0.17 rad/s** at sample 35) imply **forward/backward tilting** (e.g., bending).  

- **Z-axis**:  
  - **Major spike to 0.12 rad/s** (samples 50–60), indicating a **rapid yaw rotation** (e.g., turning the torso).

#### **3. Magnetometer Trends**  
- **X-axis**: **11–15 µT** (moderate fluctuations from orientation changes).  
- **Y-axis**: **-27 to -31 µT** (consistent with Earth’s magnetic field, minor deviations from torso rotation).  
- **Z-axis**: **-27 to -31 µT** (stable overall, aligning with vertical field component).  
- **Interpretation**: Noise and gradual shifts suggest **torso reorientation** without drastic heading changes.

### **Key Observations**  
1. **Dynamic Mid-Period Activity**:  
   - **Acceleration spikes** (x/z) and **gyroscope z-axis rotation** (samples 50–70) align with a **compound movement** (e.g., jump + turn, sit-to-stand).  
   - Magnetometer stability implies minimal heading change during the motion.  

2. **Baseline Stability**:  
   - Pre- and post-activity phases show minimal motion (stationary or slow walking).  

3. **Artifacts**:  
   - Magnetometer noise (common in indoor environments) and minor sensor jitter.

### **Activity Hypothesis**  
The data suggests a **sudden, compound torso movement** around the 5–7s mark, such as:  
- **Jumping** (x/z acceleration spikes + vertical gyro motion).  
- **Rapid turn** (z-axis gyro spike).  
- **Bending/recovery** (y-axis gyro oscillations).  

The torso-mounted placement amplifies vertical (z) and sagittal (x) accelerations, while rotational signals (gyroscopes) reflect torso-centric motions."

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Insights**  
- **Gravitational Alignment**:  
  - The **y-axis** accelerometer data (range: ~7.08–7.87 m/s²) is dominated by gravity (~9.81 m/s² projected onto the sensor’s y-axis). This indicates the torso is upright, with the y-axis aligned close to Earth’s vertical axis. Minor oscillations (~7.3–7.7 m/s²) suggest slight forward/backward tilts (e.g., posture adjustments), not locomotion.  
  - **x/z-axes** show minimal dynamic range (x: ~4.78–5.88 m/s², z: ~2.55–3.51 m/s²). The z-axis decline and recovery (samples 1–80) likely reflect vertical torso shifts (e.g., sitting down or standing up), but these are isolated events, not rhythmic patterns.  

- **Absence of Periodicity**:  
  - No repetitive oscillations (e.g., steps or vehicle vibrations). Walking/running would show periodic peaks (~1–2 Hz for walking, ~2–4 Hz for running). Car motion often includes higher-frequency vibrations or turns, which are absent here.  

### **2. Gyroscope Insights**  
- **Low Angular Velocity**:  
  - All axes show minimal rotation (x: **-0.11–0.13 rad/s**, y: **-0.18–0.16 rad/s**, z: **-0.11–0.08 rad/s**). These magnitudes are too small for walking/running (which require significant leg-driven torso rotations) or car turns (which induce sustained yaw changes).  
  - Sporadic peaks (e.g., y-axis **-0.18 rad/s** at sample 2) suggest brief torso adjustments (e.g., leaning), not sustained motion.  

### **3. Magnetometer Insights**  
- **Stable Heading**:  
  - The y/z magnetometer axes remain stable (y: **-30.51–-25.94 μT**, z: **-29.81–-26.00 μT**), indicating no significant heading changes. This rules out car turns or walking/running direction shifts.  
  - Transient x-axis spikes (e.g., **16.38 μT** at sample 43) are environmental noise (e.g., passing metal objects), not motion-related.  

### **4. Key Exclusions**  
- **Walking/Running**:  
  - No gait signatures (periodic accelerometer spikes, rhythmic gyroscope oscillations).  
  - Walking typically produces ~1–2 Hz step frequency; running ~2–4 Hz. Neither is observed.  
- **Car**:  
  - Car motion would show higher-frequency vibrations (e.g., engine noise in accelerometer data) or sustained turns (gyroscope yaw changes). Neither is present.  

### **5. Conclusion**  
- The data reflects **stationary activity** (e.g., standing, sitting) with minor torso adjustments (e.g., posture shifts, slight tilts). The absence of periodicity, low angular velocities, and stable heading confirm no locomotion or vehicular motion.","### Analysis of IMU Sensor Data Trends

- **y-axis**:  
  - **Range**: **-30.51–-25.94 μT**  
  - **Trend**: Consistent negative values (Earth’s magnetic field dominance). Minor fluctuations suggest minimal heading changes.  

- **z-axis**:  
  - **Range**: **-29.81–-26.00 μT**  
  - **Trend**: Similar to y-axis, with stable alignment and slight noise.

   - Low-intensity, non-periodic movements (e.g., standing with torso adjustments, slight tilts, or slow transitions like sitting/standing).  
   - No clear gait patterns (walking/running excluded).  

2. **Accelerometer**:  
   - Gravitational dominance on the y-axis confirms upright torso orientation.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Clues**:  
   - **y-axis (7.30–7.79 m/s²)**: Dominated by gravity (~9.8 m/s² partially aligned with the sensor), but vertical torso motion during walking introduces fluctuations. The spike at sample 83 (7.79 m/s²) and dip at sample 68 (7.34 m/s²) correlate with **stride-induced vertical oscillations** (e.g., heel strike and push-off phases).  
   - **z-axis (2.32–3.49 m/s²)**: Sudden drop at sample 80 (2.32 m/s²) followed by recovery suggests **lateral weight shift** during a turn or sidestep, common in walking with directional changes.  
   - **x-axis spikes (5.57–5.58 m/s²)**: Brief forward/backward acceleration, likely from **arm swing** or torso counter-motion during walking.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **y-axis (−0.17 to 0.14 rad/s)**: Sustained twisting/pitching motions (e.g., torso rotation during steps). The large negative swing at sample 94 aligns with **mid-stride torso rotation**.  
   - **z-axis spike (0.14 rad/s at sample 99)**: Indicates a **yaw rotation** (turning direction), consistent with walking while changing heading.  
   - **x-axis spikes**: Minor roll motions (e.g., shoulder movement during arm swings).  

3. **Magnetometer Corroboration**:  
   - **y-axis dip to −31.1 µT (sample 83)** and **z-axis fluctuations**: Reflect reorientation relative to Earth’s magnetic field, aligning with gyroscope z-axis spike (sample 99). This confirms **directional changes** during walking (e.g., turning corners).  

4. **Temporal Patterns**:  
   - **10-second duration**: Too short for prolonged running (which would show higher, rhythmic acceleration peaks) or car motion (smoother, low-variability trends).  
   - **Intermittent spikes**: Match the start-stop rhythm of walking (e.g., pauses for turns or obstacle avoidance).  

5. **Exclusion of Alternatives**:  
   - **Still**: Ruled out due to dynamic fluctuations in all axes.  
   - **Run**: Accelerometer magnitudes (y-axis ~7.79 m/s²) are lower than typical running (>10 m/s²). Gyroscope activity is less rhythmic.  
   - **Car**: Lack of sustained lateral/forward acceleration patterns (e.g., braking/steering forces).  

**Conclusion**: The combined accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer trends—vertical oscillations, lateral shifts, directional turns, and moderate intensity—are hallmarks of **Walking with turns or brief pauses**, likely in an environment requiring navigation (e.g., crowded space).","### Analysis of IMU Data (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s)

- **z-axis**:  
  - **Range**: −0.11 to 0.14 rad/s.  
  - **Trend**: Generally stable but with **spike at 0.14 rad/s** (sample 99), suggesting abrupt **yaw rotation** (e.g., head turn or torso realignment).

### **Key Inferences**
1. **Activity Type**:  
   - **Dynamic movements** (e.g., bending, twisting, or turning) dominate, with no prolonged static periods.  
   - Likely **transitional activity** (e.g., sit-to-stand, walking with directional changes).  

2. **Critical Events**:  
   - **Sample 80**: Sharp z-axis acceleration drop + y-axis magnetometer dip → **sudden lateral lean or stumble**.  
   - **Sample 99**: Z-axis gyro spike + magnetometer shifts → **rapid reorientation** (e.g., correcting balance).  

3. **Sensor Coordination**:  
   - Y-axis accelerometer and gyroscope correlate with **vertical/twisting motions**.  
   - Magnetometer y-axis aligns with Earth’s field, disrupted by torso rotations.

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **Y-axis (Vertical)**: The mean (~7.4 m/s²) is close to gravity (~9.8 m/s²), adjusted for device tilt, indicating an upright torso. Minor fluctuations (7.17–7.89 m/s²) align with vertical oscillations during walking.  
   - **X/Z-axes (Forward-Backward/Lateral)**:  
     - X-axis shows rhythmic variability (5.0–5.7 m/s²) with a spike to **6.04 m/s²**, consistent with stride-induced forward motion.  
     - Z-axis instability (2.69–3.59 m/s²) reflects lateral sway during steps.  
   - **Key**: Periodicity in X/Z aligns with step cycles, while Y-axis stability rules out high-impact activities (e.g., running).  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **Low Magnitude**: All axes show minimal rotation (mostly <0.3 rad/s). Sporadic spikes (e.g., Z-axis **-0.12 rad/s**) suggest occasional turns or head movements, not sustained motion.  
   - **Pitch (Y-axis)**: A brief spike to **0.22 rad/s** matches slight torso tilt (e.g., navigating uneven terrain), common during walking.  

3. **Magnetometer Noise**:  
   - High variability (e.g., Z-axis: **-26.8 to -29.75 μT**) is environmental (not motion-related), reinforcing reliance on accelerometer/gyroscope.  

4. **Exclusion of Other Activities**:  
   - **Still**: Requires minimal accelerometer variance (all axes near gravity) and near-zero gyroscope activity. The observed motion rejects this.  
   - **Run**: Higher accelerometer variance (>10 m/s² in X/Y) and gyroscope peaks (>1 rad/s) would be expected.  
   - **Car**: Sustained lateral/forward acceleration spikes (e.g., braking/turning) and irregular gyroscope patterns (e.g., frequent yaw changes) absent here.

### **Activity Hypothesis**:
- **Primary Motion**: **Walking** (steady accelerometer trends, minor gyro rotations).  
- **Secondary Events**:  
  - **Balance adjustments** (accelerometer spikes in X/Z).  
  - **Directional turns** (gyroscope z-axis spike).  
  - **Environmental interference** (magnetometer variability).  

### **Recommendations**:
1. Filter magnetometer noise using sensor fusion (e.g., Madgwick filter).  
2. Detect step cycles from accelerometer Y-axis periodicity.  
3. Classify turns/spikes with gyroscope thresholds.  
4. Normalize accelerometer data to account for gravity-tilt coupling.

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **Vertical Oscillations (z-axis)**: The z-axis accelerometer fluctuates between 2.4–5.73 m/s², with rhythmic peaks (e.g., 5.73 m/s²) indicative of vertical motion from steps. This aligns with **walking**, where each step generates a distinct vertical acceleration. Running would typically show higher magnitudes (>7 m/s²).  
   - **Lateral and Forward Spikes**: The y-axis peaks at **8.07 m/s²** (sideways sway) and x-axis spikes at **6.87 m/s²** (forward/backward motion) correlate with torso adjustments during directional changes or step initiation, not sustained motion like running or car movement.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **Rotational Activity**: Moderate x/y-axis gyro spikes (e.g., 0.35 rad/s roll, 0.26 rad/s pitch) suggest torso tilts and leans during turns or balance adjustments. The z-axis yaw spike (**0.28 rad/s**) supports directional changes, consistent with walking in a non-linear path. Car motion would involve smoother, prolonged rotations (e.g., during turns), absent here.  

3. **Magnetometer Trends**:  
   - **Gradual Orientation Shifts**: The x-axis magnetometer increases from 11.88 to 20.63 μT, and the y-axis declines steadily (-28.19 to -34.63 μT), reflecting a curved or turning path. This matches **walking with directional changes**, not the linear or static patterns of ""Still"" or ""Car.""  

4. **Temporal Phases**:  
   - **Initial 5 seconds**: Moderate accelerations (z-axis ~4–5 m/s²) and gyrations align with steady walking.  
   - **Final 5 seconds**: Increased sensor variability (e.g., x/y accelerometer spikes, gyro peaks) suggests dynamic adjustments (e.g., stopping, turning), typical of urban walking.  

5. **Eliminating Other Classes**:  
   - **Still**: No sustained vertical oscillations or rotational spikes.  
   - **Run**: Higher-frequency, larger-magnitude z-axis peaks expected.  
   - **Car**: Smoother accelerations (lack of rhythmic steps) and stronger magnetometer shifts from sustained velocity changes.  

**Conclusion**: The combined sensor data—rhythmic vertical steps, torso rotations, and gradual magnetic orientation shifts—strongly indicate **Walking** with intermittent turns and adjustments.","### Summary of Sensor Data Analysis:

   - The **Y-axis accelerometer** (5.30–9.50 m/s²) shows **sustained high-amplitude oscillations** (e.g., peaks at 9.50 m/s²). These rhythmic forward/backward accelerations are characteristic of **torso motion during walking**, where each step generates a push-off and deceleration phase.  
   - The **X-axis** (3.89–7.35 m/s²) and **Z-axis** (1.85–5.96 m/s²) exhibit smaller fluctuations, consistent with lateral shifts and vertical bounce during gait. The absence of gravity-dominated axes (e.g., ~9.8 m/s² in static postures) confirms dynamic activity.  

2. **Gyroscope Spikes Correlate with Steps:**  
   - **Intermittent rotational spikes** (e.g., X-axis: 0.47 rad/s, Y-axis: 0.40 rad/s) align with **torso rotation and sway** during walking. The alternating positive/negative Y-axis peaks suggest rotational adjustments per step.  
   - **Low baseline noise** (±0.5 rad/s) indicates stable torso orientation between steps, ruling out chaotic motions like running or car movements.  

3. **Magnetometer Stability:**  
   - **Y/Z-axes** show a stable negative bias, aligning with Earth’s magnetic field. The **X-axis** gradual shifts (8.25–15.80 µT) suggest minor torso tilt during motion but no drastic reorientation, supporting a controlled gait.  

4. **Exclusion of Other Activities:**  
   - **Still:** Ruled out due to dynamic accelerometer ranges and absence of gravity-dominated axes.  
   - **Run:** Accelerations (Y-axis ≤9.50 m/s²) are lower than typical running peaks (>10 m/s²). Gyroscope magnitudes (±0.5 rad/s) also lack the sustained high angular rates of running.  
   - **Car:** Magnetometer stability and rhythmic accelerations contradict vehicular motion (e.g., abrupt turns or acceleration surges).  

**Conclusion:**  
The **rhythmic Y-axis accelerometer oscillations**, **step-correlated gyroscope spikes**, and **stable magnetometer trends** collectively indicate **Walking**. The data reflects a controlled, repetitive gait without extreme forces or rotations.","### Analysis of IMU Data Trends and Distributions

### **Summary of Trend Distributions**  
| Sensor       | X-axis Trend          | Y-axis Trend              | Z-axis Trend          |

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Data (Key Indicator of Ambulation):**  
   - **Y-axis Dominance:** The y-axis (vertical in torso frame) shows sustained accelerations (5.58–7.99 m/s²) with rhythmic fluctuations. This matches the vertical oscillation pattern of the torso during **walking**, where each step induces a periodic up-down motion.  
   - **Magnitude Exclusion of Running:** Peak accelerations (~7.2 m/s²) are far below the >10 m/s² spikes typical of running. The absence of erratic/jagged peaks also rules out high-impact activities.  
   - **Lateral Motion (X/Z-axes):** Moderate variability in x/z-axes (4.47–5.81 m/s²) suggests natural arm swings or slight posture adjustments during walking, not the lateral sway of a car ride.  

2. **Gyroscope Data (Rotation Analysis):**  
   - **Intermittent Turns (Z-axis):** Sporadic z-axis angular velocity spikes (±0.30 rad/s) correlate with directional changes (e.g., turning while walking). A car would show smoother, sustained rotations during turns.  
   - **Torso Rotations (X-axis):** Sharp x-axis spikes (±0.47 rad/s) align with torso twists during step transitions or obstacle avoidance, consistent with walking in a variable path.  

3. **Magnetometer Data (Heading Validation):**  
   - **Stable Y-axis (Earth-Aligned):** The y-axis magnetometer (-27.37 to -22.13 µT) remains stable, confirming the device is upright and aligned with Earth’s magnetic field—unlikely in a car, where device orientation often varies.  
   - **X/Z-axis Shifts During Turns:** Fluctuations in x/z-axes (6.81–13.82 µT and -39.0 to -31.94 µT) correlate with gyroscope’s turning activity, reinforcing walking with directional changes.  

4. **Activity Differentiation:**  
   - **Still:** Ruled out due to rhythmic accelerometer fluctuations and gyroscope activity.  
   - **Run:** Excluded by low acceleration magnitudes (no >10 m/s² peaks) and lack of high-frequency gyroscope oscillations.  
   - **Car:** Inconsistent with magnetometer’s Earth-aligned stability and the torso-specific rotational signatures (cars involve whole-body motion, not isolated torso rotations).  

**Conclusion:** The combined sensor trends—rhythmic vertical accelerations (walking cadence), intermittent turns (gyroscope z-axis), and Earth-aligned magnetometer—strongly indicate **Walking**, likely with occasional turns or path adjustments.","### Sensor Data Analysis Summary

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **x/y-axes**: Mean values (~6.0 m/s² for x, ~6.8 m/s² for y) and peaks up to **7.5–8.0 m/s²** indicate rhythmic horizontal motion. These magnitudes align with torso sway during walking rather than running (which would show higher sustained accelerations) or car motion (which would lack periodic sway).  
   - **z-axis**: High variability (1.3–5.1 m/s²) with sharp drops (e.g., 1.3 m/s²) and peaks (5.1 m/s²) correlates with vertical motion from foot strikes during walking. Stillness or car motion would lack such periodic vertical dynamics.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **y-axis**: Spikes (e.g., −0.38 rad/s) suggest forward torso tilts during steps, consistent with walking. Running would show larger, faster rotations.  
   - **x-axis**: Alternating ±0.2–0.3 rad/s values reflect lateral torso shifts during step transitions, a hallmark of walking. Car motion would lack such rhythmic shifts.  
   - **z-axis**: Minimal rotation (~±0.2 rad/s) rules out sharp turns (e.g., in a car) or erratic movements.  

3. **Magnetometer Stability**:  
   - **y-axis**: Stable **−25 μT** indicates a fixed forward direction, ruling out car turns or erratic heading changes.  
   - **x/z-axes**: Gradual shifts (e.g., x: 6.9 → 12.4 μT) suggest minor orientation adjustments during walking, not vehicle motion.  

4. **Activity Consistency**:  
   - **Periodicity**: Accelerometer and gyroscope trends show rhythmic, repetitive patterns (steps) over 10 seconds, inconsistent with stillness or car motion.  
   - **Intensity**: Moderate x/y accelerations and low-to-moderate gyroscope magnitudes align with walking, not running (higher intensity) or car (smoother accelerations).  

**Conclusion**: The combined sensor data—rhythmic horizontal sway, vertical foot-strike patterns, and stable heading—strongly indicate **Walking**.","The provided IMU data from a smartphone attached to the torso reveals the following trends and characteristics:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Analysis**
- **Magnitudes**:
  - **x/y-axes**: Dominant acceleration values between **5–7 m/s²**, with occasional peaks up to **7.5 m/s²** (e.g., x-axis peaks at 7.57 m/s², y-axis at 8.01 m/s²). This suggests moderate-to-high horizontal motion (e.g., torso sway, lateral steps).
  - **z-axis**: Lower values (**1.3–5.1 m/s²**) compared to gravity-aligned static conditions (~9.8 m/s²). This indicates dynamic vertical motion (e.g., bending, jumping, or sensor tilt).

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **Z-axis**: The most significant dynamic range (1.7–4.76 m/s²) with sharp early peaks and sustained oscillations strongly suggests **vertical motion** from steps. Gravity (~9.8 m/s²) is partially canceled due to torso tilt, but the cyclical peaks align with heel strikes during walking.  
   - **Y-axis**: Gradual drift (6.8 → 7.73 → 6.5–6.8 m/s²) correlates with forward/backward torso motion during ambulation.  
   - **X-axis**: Smaller oscillations (~5.2–6.95 m/s²) indicate lateral swaying, typical of balance adjustments while walking.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **Y-axis (pitch)**: Spikes (-0.457 to 0.274 rad/s) match torso lean during stride initiation and stabilization.  
   - **X/Z-axes (roll/yaw)**: Minor fluctuations (-0.14–0.19 rad/s for roll, -0.075–0.102 rad/s for yaw) reflect natural torso adjustments (e.g., arm swings, slight turns) without large rotations.  

3. **Activity Intensity**:  
   - **Vertical acceleration periodicity** (~1–2 Hz) aligns with a walking cadence (1.5–2 steps/second). Running would show higher frequency (>2.5 Hz) and larger amplitudes (>5 m/s² in Z-axis).  
   - **Lack of sustained high-frequency noise** in accelerometer/gyroscope data rules out running or vehicular motion (e.g., car vibrations typically show higher-frequency, irregular spikes).  

4. **Magnetometer Context**:  
   - **X-axis drift** (8.6→16.25 µT) suggests directional changes, but environmental interference limits reliability. This aligns with walking in an indoor/urban area with metal structures.  

5. **Eliminating Alternatives**:  
   - **Still**: Requires minimal acceleration variance (near gravity) and no rotational spikes—contradicted by dynamic Z-axis and pitch gyro activity.  
   - **Car**: Would show prolonged lateral/forward acceleration (e.g., braking/turning) and lower vertical oscillation. The torso’s vertical motion here is inconsistent with passive vehicular movement.  
   - **Run**: Higher Z-axis peaks (>5 m/s²) and gyroscope magnitudes (e.g., pitch >1 rad/s) expected. Observed data lacks these traits.  

**Conclusion**: The combined IMU trends—moderate vertical oscillations, forward-leaning pitch rotations, and balance-related sway—are hallmarks of **walking**. The absence of high-intensity spikes or vehicular noise further supports this classification.","### Sensor Data Analysis Summary:

### **Key Observations & Activity Inference:**
1. **Dominant Motion**:  
   - **Vertical acceleration (Z-axis)** shows the strongest dynamic range, suggesting repetitive vertical motion (e.g., **walking** or stair climbing).  
   - **Y-axis acceleration** supports forward/backward torso movement.  

2. **Rotational Dynamics**:  
   - **Pitch (Y-axis gyro)** spikes imply torso bending (e.g., picking up an object).  
   - **Roll (X-axis gyro)** and **yaw (Z-axis gyro)** are milder, indicating minor balance adjustments.  

3. **Magnetometer Noise**:  
   - Non-smooth trends in magnetometer data likely reflect environmental interference (e.g., indoor metal objects) rather than pure orientation changes.  

4. **Periodicity**:  
   - Acceleration and gyroscope data lack high-frequency noise, ruling out running/jumping. Likely **low-to-moderate intensity activity** (e.g., walking with pauses).

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Evidence**  
- **X-axis**: Stable baseline (~5.7–6.0 m/s²) with minor fluctuations (e.g., 6.05 m/s² at sample 28). This aligns with **forward motion** from torso lean or step propulsion, typical of walking.  
- **Z-axis**: Variability (~3.9–4.3 m/s²) with periodic dips (e.g., 3.97 m/s²) and peaks (e.g., 4.31 m/s²). These oscillations match **vertical torso movement** during steps, a hallmark of walking.  
- **Gravity Distribution**: Z-axis gravity magnitude (~4 m/s²) confirms device tilt (e.g., mounted on torso), distributing gravity across axes. This tilt is consistent with a walking posture.  

### **2. Gyroscope Evidence**  
- **Low Angular Velocity**: All axes show minimal rotation (e.g., Y-axis: -0.045 to 0.032 rad/s). Spikes (e.g., -0.045 rad/s at sample 15) suggest **balance adjustments** or arm swings during walking, not rapid turns (as in a car) or high-intensity motion (as in running).  
- **Steady-State Activity**: Near-zero Z-axis rotation (~-0.008 to 0.01 rad/s) indicates stable heading, ruling out erratic movements like running or vehicle turns.  

### **3. Magnetometer Evidence**  
- **Subtle Orientation Shifts**: X-axis variability (13.25–15.81 μT) and Y-axis dips (e.g., -25.75 μT) correlate with **torso rotations during steps**, not large directional changes (e.g., car turns).  
- **Stable Magnetic Field**: Z-axis stability (-36.4 to -38.8 μT) reflects consistent Earth’s vertical component, reinforcing steady ambulation.  

### **Activity Differentiation**  
- **Still**: Excluded due to accelerometer variability (e.g., Z-axis oscillations) and gyroscope spikes.  
- **Run**: Excluded due to insufficient acceleration magnitude (running Z-axis peaks typically exceed 5 m/s²) and lack of high-frequency gyroscope activity.  
- **Car**: Excluded due to absence of sustained lateral/rotational forces (e.g., sharp turns in magnetometer, prolonged gyroscope deviations).  

### **Conclusion**  
The combination of **rhythmic vertical oscillations (walking steps)**, **steady forward motion**, and **minor balance adjustments** confirms **Walking** as the activity.","The IMU data collected from the torso-mounted smartphone reveals the following trends and key elements:

### **1. Accelerometer Analysis**  
- **Magnitudes and Trends**:  
  - **X-axis**: Stable baseline (~5.7–6.0 m/s²) with minor fluctuations (e.g., a spike to **6.05 m/s²** at sample 28). Suggests consistent forward/backward motion (e.g., torso leaning or steps).  
  - **Y-axis**: Tightly clustered (~6.5–6.65 m/s²), indicating minimal lateral movement. Likely reflects postural stability.  
  - **Z-axis**: Higher variability (~3.9–4.3 m/s²), with dips (e.g., **3.97 m/s²**) and peaks (e.g., **4.31 m/s²**). Aligns with vertical oscillations (e.g., walking or torso adjustments).  

- **Gravity vs. Motion**:  
  - Lower-than-expected gravity magnitude (~4 m/s² on Z-axis) suggests device tilt (gravity distributed across axes).  
  - Combined motion and tilt effects dominate X/Y axes, while Z-axis captures vertical dynamics.

### **2. Gyroscope Analysis**  
- **Rotation Dynamics**:  
  - **X-axis**: Near-zero baseline with transient spikes (e.g., **-0.039 rad/s** at sample 63). Brief torso twists or balance adjustments.  
  - **Y-axis**: Moderate fluctuations (**-0.045 to 0.032 rad/s**), including a sharp negative spike (**-0.045 rad/s** at sample 15). Suggests occasional lateral tilting or turning.  
  - **Z-axis**: Minimal rotation (**-0.008 to 0.01 rad/s**), indicating stable heading.  

- **Overall**: Low angular velocities, consistent with steady-state activity (e.g., walking) rather than rapid turns.  

---

### **3. Magnetometer Analysis**  
- **Magnetic Field Trends**:  
  - **X-axis**: Moderate variability (**13.25–15.81 μT**), likely due to orientation shifts relative to Earth’s magnetic field.  
  - **Y-axis**: Strong negative baseline (**-23.25 to -25.75 μT**) with dips (e.g., **-25.75 μT**), possibly during directional changes.  
  - **Z-axis**: Stable negative field (**-36.4 to -38.8 μT**), typical of Earth’s vertical component.  

- **Interpretation**: Variations align with torso orientation changes (e.g., walking in a fixed direction with slight body rotations).  

---

### **Activity Inference**  
- **Dominant Motion**:  
  - **Linear Acceleration**: Periodic X/Z-axis fluctuations suggest **walking** or light jogging (torso vertical oscillations + forward motion).  
  - **Rotation**: Minor gyroscope spikes imply balance corrections or arm swings during movement.  
  - **Orientation**: Magnetometer shifts correlate with heading changes (e.g., turning).  

- **Key Features**:  
  - **Accelerometer**: Vertical (Z-axis) variability (~0.4 m/s²) and forward (X-axis) consistency.  
  - **Gyroscope**: Low-energy rotational noise with rare spikes.  
  - **Magnetometer**: Directional stability with subtle orientation shifts.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:  

1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **y-axis (Lateral Motion)**: Sustained elevated values (~6.4–6.7 m/s²) with periodic dips (e.g., **6.41 m/s²** at sample 7) indicate **side-to-side swaying**, a hallmark of walking.  
   - **z-axis (Vertical Oscillations)**: High variability (3.7–4.4 m/s²) with sharp drops/peaks (e.g., **3.73 m/s²** at sample 17 and **4.37 m/s²** at sample 100) align with **heel strikes** and **torso vertical motion** during steps.  
   - **x-axis (Forward/Backward)**: Minor fluctuations (5.8–6.2 m/s²) with transient spikes (e.g., **6.24 m/s²** at sample 20) suggest **forward propulsion** from steps, not intense enough for running.  

2. **Gyroscope Activity**:  
   - **x-axis spike (-0.13 rad/s at sample 18)**: Likely a **brief torso twist** (e.g., adjusting direction mid-walk).  
   - **Low-magnitude y/z-axis rotations**: Consistent with arm swings and balance corrections during walking, not the sustained rotations of running or car motion.  

3. **Magnetometer Trends**:  
   - Gradual shifts (e.g., z-axis drift to **-38.06 µT**) reflect **heading changes** as the person moves forward, not abrupt turns or vehicle motion.  

4. **Exclusion of Other Activities**:  
   - **Still**: Requires stable accelerometer values near gravity (~9.8 m/s² on one axis). The tilted orientation (low z-axis) and rhythmic fluctuations rule this out.  
   - **Run**: Higher accelerometer magnitudes (>2g peaks) and more frequent gyroscope spikes would be expected.  
   - **Car**: Sustained vibrations, linear accelerations (e.g., braking), or rotational patterns from turns would dominate; absent here.  

**Conclusion**: Rhythmic lateral/vertical accelerometer patterns, intermittent rotational spikes, and gradual heading changes strongly correlate with **walking**. The sudden x-axis gyroscope spike suggests a minor turn or posture adjustment during locomotion.","### Analysis Summary of IMU Sensor Data Trends:

**Analysis**:  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**:  
- **X/Y-axis**: Initial surges (6.6 m/s² in X, 6.98 m/s² in Y) suggest a brief forward/backward motion (e.g., torso adjustment). However, after ~4 seconds, values stabilize near **6.2–6.3 m/s²**, aligning with gravity-dominated stillness.  
- **Z-axis**: Drops to **3.5 m/s²** (gravity reduction) early, indicating bending (e.g., sitting), then fluctuates mildly (3.3–4.1 m/s²), consistent with stationary posture.  

### **2. Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
- **Early Phase**: Spikes in X (0.13 rad/s), Y (-0.15 rad/s), and Z (0.07 rad/s) suggest torso rotations (e.g., rebalancing).  
- **Late Phase**: Noise reduces to **±0.02 rad/s** (all axes), indicating minimal movement after ~4 seconds.  

### **3. Magnetometer Stability**:  
- Minor fluctuations (e.g., X: 11.8–15.5 μT) reflect slight reorientation, but no sustained heading changes. Steady Y/Z fields align with Earth’s magnetic field, confirming no prolonged motion.  

### **4. Activity Breakdown**:  
- **0–4 seconds**: Transient dynamics (acceleration surges, rotational spikes) likely correspond to a **controlled transition** (e.g., sitting down, adjusting posture).  
- **5–10 seconds**: All sensors stabilize—accelerometers align with gravity, gyroscopes near zero, magnetometers steady. This dominates 60% of the data, strongly supporting **stillness**.  

### **Eliminating Other Activities**:  
- **Walking/Running**: Requires periodic step-induced oscillations in accelerometer/gyroscope. No cyclic patterns observed.  
- **Car**: Would show sustained vibrations/linear acceleration (e.g., braking/turning). The late-phase stability rules this out.  

**Conclusion**: The dominant postural stability (last 6–7 seconds) overshadows the brief initial motion, aligning with **Still** as the final action. The early dynamics likely reflect a preparatory movement (e.g., sitting) before prolonged stillness.","### Summary of Sensor Data Analysis:

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **Horizontal Plane Dominance**: The x/y axes (6.0–6.4 m/s²) show steady linear motion with minor fluctuations, consistent with forward/lateral movement during walking. The absence of extreme peaks (>10 m/s²) rules out running.  
   - **Vertical Oscillations (z-axis)**: Periodic peaks (~4.1–4.2 m/s²) align with rhythmic vertical torso motion from steps. Running would exhibit higher-frequency/larger-magnitude oscillations.  
   - **Gravity Compensation**: The z-axis magnitude (~4 m/s²) suggests the device is tilted, distributing gravity across axes, typical for torso-mounted sensors during ambulation.  

2. **Gyroscope Stability**:  
   - **Low Rotational Activity**: All axes remain near zero (±0.05 rad/s), with sporadic minor spikes likely from arm swings or balance adjustments. Sustained rotations (e.g., car turns) or high angular velocity (running) are absent.  

3. **Magnetometer Consistency**:  
   - **Stable Heading**: The y/z axes (-23.5 to -39.5 µT) show minimal deviation, indicating no drastic directional changes. The x-axis variability (12.3–14.5 µT) matches periodic torso sway during walking.  

4. **Activity Intensity**:  
   - **Acceleration Magnitude**: Horizontal accelerations (6.0–6.4 m/s²) and vertical oscillations (3.8–4.2 m/s²) match walking dynamics. Running would produce higher magnitudes (e.g., z-axis >5 m/s²).  
   - **Step Rhythm**: 10Hz sampling over 10s yields ~100 data points. Cyclic z-axis peaks (~1 peak every 10–15 samples) suggest a cadence of ~2 steps/second (~120 steps/minute), typical for walking.  

5. **Eliminating Alternatives**:  
   - **Still**: Requires near-zero accelerometer variance (absent here).  
   - **Run**: Higher acceleration magnitudes (>8 m/s²) and gyroscope activity expected.  
   - **Car**: Magnetometer would show sharp heading changes, and accelerations would reflect vehicular motion (e.g., braking/acceleration spikes).  

**Conclusion**: The combined sensor trends—steady linear motion, rhythmic vertical oscillations, minimal rotation, and stable heading—are definitive of **walking**.","### Analysis of IMU Data for Torso-Mounted Smartphone (10Hz, 10s)

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**  

1. **Accelerometer Dynamics (Key to Motion Type):**  
   - **Z-Axis (Vertical):** The sudden drop to ~2.17 m/s² at 1.5 sec resembles a free-fall event, followed by oscillations (2–7 sec) and stabilization at lower values (7–10 sec). This pattern aligns with abrupt deceleration/acceleration (e.g., hard braking followed by resumed motion).  
   - **X/Y-Axes (Horizontal):** Mid-session variability (sharp drops/spikes) and sustained elevation in Y-axis (~7–8 m/s²) suggest lateral forces, consistent with vehicle maneuvers (e.g., swerving, turning).  

2. **Gyroscope Correlations (Rotational Cues):**  
   - **Pitch (Y-Axis):** A large negative spike (-0.41 rad/s) at 1.5 sec matches the accelerometer’s z-axis dip, indicating forward pitch (e.g., sudden braking).  
   - **Roll (X-Axis):** Spikes (0.34 rad/s and -0.36 rad/s) suggest lateral tilts, as in sharp turns or lane changes.  
   - **Absence of Cyclic Patterns:** No rhythmic oscillations (ruling out Walking/Run).  

3. **Magnetometer Drift (Orientation Context):**  
   - **X-Axis Collapse (12→0 µT):** Sudden loss of magnetic alignment suggests rapid heading changes (e.g., vehicle turning sharply).  
   - **Y/Z Drifts:** Gradual decreases align with prolonged motion in a fixed direction (e.g., highway driving).  

4. **Activity Elimination:**  
   - **Still:** Requires minimal acceleration/gyro variance, conflicting with observed dynamics.  
   - **Walking/Run:** High-frequency periodic patterns absent; torso-mounted IMU would show rhythmic strides.  
   - **Car:** Matches transient forces (braking, acceleration, turns) and magnetometer reorientation during vehicular motion.  

**Conclusion:** The IMU data reflects abrupt deceleration (free-fall-like z-axis drop), lateral forces, and rotational spikes consistent with **vehicular motion** (e.g., hard braking, swerving, or acceleration in a car). The absence of cyclic human motion and sustained drift in magnetometer further support this classification.","The IMU data captures a 10-second window of torso-mounted sensor readings, sampled at 10Hz. Below is a structured analysis of the trends and key elements in the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data:

- **Initial Stability (0–1.5 sec):**  
  - X: ~6.3 m/s², Y: ~6.1–6.2 m/s² (steady baseline with minor fluctuations).  
  - Likely reflects upright posture or minimal torso motion.  
- **Mid-Session Variability (1.5–7 sec):**  
  - Sharp drops (e.g., X: 5.4→3.8 m/s²; Y: 7.9→7.3 m/s²) and irregular spikes (e.g., X: 6.9 m/s² at 6.4 sec).  
  - Suggests abrupt movements (e.g., bending, recovery, or instability).  
- **Final Phase (7–10 sec):**  
  - X stabilizes ~4–5 m/s²; Y remains elevated (~7–8 m/s²).  
  - Indicates sustained motion or postural adjustment.

#### **Z-Axis (Vertical):**  
- **Initial Dip (1.5 sec):**  
  - Sudden drop from ~4.1 m/s² to **2.17 m/s²** (free-fall-like signature).  
- **Recovery and Oscillations (2–7 sec):**  
  - Rebounds to ~5.7 m/s², then fluctuates between 2.2–5.0 m/s².  
  - Suggests impact (e.g., landing) followed by unstable vertical motion.  
- **Late Stability (7–10 sec):**  
  - Settles at ~2–3 m/s² (lower than baseline, possibly tilted orientation).

---

### **2. Gyroscope Trends**
#### **Rotational Dynamics:**  
- **X-Axis (Roll):**  
  - Spikes at 1.5 sec (**0.34 rad/s**) and 7 sec (**-0.36 rad/s**), indicating abrupt torso rotations.  
- **Y-Axis (Pitch):**  
  - Large negative spike (-0.41 rad/s at 1.5 sec), aligning with the accelerometer’s z-axis dip (forward/backward tilt).  
- **Z-Axis (Yaw):**  
  - Moderate fluctuations (-0.19→0.08 rad/s), suggesting limited horizontal turning.  

#### **Event Correlation:**  
- Gyroscopic spikes **coincide with accelerometer anomalies** (1.5 sec and 6–7 sec), marking critical motion phases (e.g., fall initiation and recovery attempts).

---

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**
#### **Orientation Shifts:**  
- **X-Axis (Heading):**  
  - Declines from ~12–13 µT to **near 0 µT** (possible device reorientation or loss of magnetic alignment).  
- **Y/Z-Axes:**  
  - Y: Steady decrease (-24→-18 µT); Z: Drifts from -39→-45 µT.  
  - Reflects torso rotation or environmental interference (unlikely to be Earth’s field alone).

---

### **4. Key Inferences**
1. **Dynamic Event (1.5–2 sec):**  
   - Sudden z-axis acceleration drop + y-axis gyro spike → **Forward/backward fall** or **stumble** with torso rotation.  
2. **Recovery Phase (2–7 sec):**  
   - Erratic accelerometer/gyroscope fluctuations → Attempted stabilization or repeated motions (e.g., standing up, adjusting posture).  
3. **Final Orientation (7–10 sec):**  
   - Lower z-axis acceleration + magnetometer drift → Torso likely tilted (e.g., leaning forward or seated).

---

### **Activity Hypothesis**  
The data aligns with a **fall followed by recovery motions** (e.g., slipping, tripping) or a **controlled dynamic activity** (e.g., sit-to-stand, exercise burpees). The magnetometer’s drift suggests significant reorientation, supporting a fall scenario. The absence of high-frequency periodic patterns rules out cyclic motions (e.g., walking).  

**Recommendation:** Cross-validate with video/annotation data to confirm transient events (falls, stumbles) or intentional maneuvers."

### **1. Accelerometer Evidence**  
- **y-axis**: Sustained high acceleration (7–8.5 m/s²) with peaks up to **9.5 m/s²**, exceeding typical walking ranges (2–3 m/s²). This aligns with **vigorous forward motion** (e.g., running).  
- **z-axis**: Repeated sharp dips (e.g., **1.2 m/s²**) and peaks (~4 m/s²) indicate **vertical oscillations** from forceful foot strikes during running, distinct from walking’s gentler steps.  
- **x-axis**: Spikes (e.g., **7.0 m/s²**) suggest lateral torso sway or arm swings, common in running.

- **x-axis**: Occasional roll spikes (e.g., **0.31 rad/s**) align with asymmetrical arm swings or torso rotation.  
- **z-axis**: Minimal yaw rotation (-0.21–0.17 rad/s) rules out turning motions (e.g., Car activity).  

### **3. Magnetometer Context**  
- **x-axis**: Sharp polarity reversals (e.g., **-7.1 µT to 2.6 µT**) correlate with device reorientation during dynamic strides.

- A **forward bend** (z-axis acceleration drop due to reduced gravity component).  
- A **twisting motion** (gyroscope x/y/z spikes).  
- Followed by stabilization (return to resting state).  

This pattern aligns with activities like **sit-ups, trunk rotations, or quick directional changes**. The magnetometer’s transient response further supports reorientation during the motion."

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:  

1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **Y-axis (forward motion)**: Sustained high values (7–8.5 m/s²) with rhythmic dips and peaks. This matches the cyclical forward acceleration of **walking**, where each step generates a forward thrust.  
   - **Z-axis (vertical motion)**: Periodic spikes (up to ~5.16 m/s²) correlate with vertical oscillations during steps. The mid/late spikes (~4–5 m/s²) align with heel strikes and upward torso motion, typical of walking.  
   - **X-axis (lateral motion)**: Moderate fluctuations (4.47–7.7 m/s²) suggest balance adjustments or slight torso sway, consistent with arm swings during walking.  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **Pitch (y-axis)**: Oscillations (-0.28 to +0.32 rad/s) reflect rhythmic forward/backward torso tilting during steps.  
   - **Low-magnitude rotations** (x/z-axes): Minor roll/yaw changes (±0.25 rad/s) indicate balance corrections or arm movements, not intense enough for running.  

3. **Magnetometer Stability**:  
   - **Y/Z-axis consistency**: Stable negative values align with Earth’s magnetic field, suggesting linear movement without turns.  
   - **X-axis spikes**: Likely environmental noise (e.g., passing metal objects), not indicative of directional changes.  

4. **Exclusion of Other Activities**:  
   - **Still**: Ruled out due to significant accelerometer/gyroscope variability.  
   - **Run**: Higher vertical acceleration (>6 m/s²) and gyroscope magnitudes (>0.5 rad/s) expected. Observed z-axis peaks (~5 m/s²) and low gyro spikes align better with walking.  
   - **Car**: Lacks rhythmic vertical oscillations (z-axis) and would show sustained linear acceleration/deceleration (e.g., smoother y-axis trends).  

**Conclusion**: The cyclical y/z-axis accelerations, low-magnitude torso rotations, and stable heading confirm **walking**. Late accelerometer spikes (~6–7 m/s²) suggest increased pace but remain within walking thresholds.","### Analysis of IMU Sensor Data Trends

   - **3–8s**: Dynamic turning (magnetometer reorientation, gyro y-axis spikes).  
   - **8–10s**: Sudden deceleration (x/z-axis drops) and posture stabilization (Still transition).  

5. **Eliminating Alternatives**:  
   - **Run**: Acceleration magnitudes (x: up to 8.16 m/s²) are lower than typical running (>10 m/s²).

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer Patterns**:  
   - **x-axis** (3.77 → 6.77 m/s²): Sustained increase with minor fluctuations aligns with forward motion during walking. The absence of extreme spikes (e.g., >10 m/s²) rules out **Run**.  
   - **y-axis** (12.66 → 6.06 m/s²): Initial high values reflect upright posture (gravity dominance). The drop suggests torso forward lean during walking, distinct from **Still** (stable gravity alignment) or **Car** (lateral/backward forces).  
   - **z-axis** (0.52 → 4.74 m/s²): Vertical oscillations match step-induced torso movements, inconsistent with **Car** (smoother z-axis in steady driving).  

2. **Gyroscope Dynamics**:  
   - **y-axis** (-0.71 → 0.25 rad/s): Negative-to-positive rotation indicates torso turning (e.g., pivoting mid-walk). This contrasts with **Car**, where turns involve smoother yaw (z-axis) rotations, not torso twists.  
   - **x/z-axes**: Minimal activity (near-zero) excludes **Run** (higher rotational dynamics) or **Car** (steering-related yaw).  

3. **Magnetometer Shifts**:  
   - **x-axis** (-14.38 → 2.88 µT) and **y-axis** (-18.75 → 5.56 µT): Sharp reversals confirm a ~180° directional turn, incompatible with **Still** or straight-line **Car** motion.  

4. **Temporal Segmentation**:  
   - **0–5s**: High y-axis acceleration (upright posture) transitioning to x/z motion (walking initiation).  
   - **5–10s**: Rising x-axis acceleration (steady gait) + magnetometer/gyroscope reversals (turn).  

**Conclusion**: The combined evidence (forward acceleration, step-like z-axis oscillations, torso rotation, and magnetic field reversal) strongly supports **Walking with a mid-activity turn**. The absence of high-frequency jolts (e.g., car braking) or extreme velocities (running) rules out other classes.","### Summary of IMU Sensor Data Analysis (Torso-Mounted, 10Hz, 10s)

#### **3. Magnetometer Data Trends**
- **x-axis**:  
  - **Range**: -14.38 → 2.88 µT

---

### **Key Observations**  
1. **Activity Phases**:  
   - **0–5s**: High y-axis acceleration (gravity-dominated upright posture), transitioning to motion-driven x/z acceleration.  
   - **5–10s**: Increased x/z acceleration (dynamic movement), gyroscopic rotation (y-axis), and magnetometer shifts (torso turning).  

2. **Motion Type**:  
   Likely **walking with a directional turn** (e.g., pivoting 180° mid-activity). Gyroscope y-axis peaks and magnetometer x/y reversals support rotational movement.  

3. **Noise/Artifacts**:  
   - Magnetometer x/y axes show abrupt jumps (environmental interference or hard iron distortions).  
   - Accelerometer z-axis volatility suggests non-smooth torso motion (e.g., uneven steps).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The data reflects **a compound activity**: initial upright posture (gravity-aligned y-axis), transitioning to forward motion (rising x-axis acceleration), followed by a torso rotation (gyroscope y-axis peaks and magnetometer reversals). The magnetometer confirms significant orientation changes, while accelerometer trends align with gait-like motion. This could represent **walking followed by a turn** or **dynamic exercise movements** (e.g., lunges with twists)."

**Analysis:**  
1. **Accelerometer**:  
   - The z-axis shows a **sharp drop** (3 m/s² → 1.25 m/s²) followed by recovery, indicating a **forward torso tilt** (e.g., bending to pick up an object) and return to upright posture.  
   - x/y-axes remain stable (~4–6 m/s²), ruling out sustained motion like walking/running.  

2. **Gyroscope**:  
   - Minimal fluctuations (±0.15 rad/s) with a minor z-axis spike (0.17 rad/s) during tilt/recovery. This reflects **controlled, non-repetitive movement**, inconsistent with walking/running (which would show rhythmic rotations).  

3. **Magnetometer**:  
   - x-axis polarity reversal (+5.37 µT → -5.44 µT) confirms **torso reorientation** during bending. y/z-axes remain aligned with Earth’s field, excluding vehicular motion (which would cause chaotic magnetic shifts).  

**Conclusion**:  
The data captures a **single postural transition** (forward bend + recovery) with no sustained or periodic motion. This aligns with **Still**, as the activity involves brief movement within an otherwise static state (e.g., adjusting posture while standing/sitting). Walking/Run require cyclic patterns, and Car motion would show prolonged acceleration/magnetic noise.","The IMU data collected from the torso-mounted smartphone over 10 seconds reveals distinct trends in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer signals, suggesting a **postural transition involving torso tilting and orientation changes**. Below is the analysis of key elements and their trend distributions:

---

### **1. Accelerometer Analysis**
- **x/y-axis**:  
  - **Range**: ~4–6 m/s² (stable with minor fluctuations).  
  - **Trend**: Both axes show steady dynamic acceleration, likely reflecting torso movement. The y-axis values are slightly higher (~8 m/s²), possibly due to gravitational coupling during tilting.  
- **z-axis**:  
  - **Range**: Drastic drop from ~3 m/s² to **1.25 m/s²** (sample 30–40), then gradual recovery to ~2–3 m/s².  
  - **Trend**: Sharp decline indicates a **forward torso tilt** (reduced alignment with gravity), followed by stabilization as posture normalizes.  

**Key Insight**: The z-axis trend strongly suggests a **bending-forward motion** (e.g., picking up an object) followed by return to upright posture.

---

### **2. Gyroscope Analysis**
- **x/y/z-axes**:  
  - **Range**: Small fluctuations near zero (±0.15 rad/s), with occasional spikes (e.g., z-axis spike to **0.17 rad/s**).  
  - **Trend**: Minimal rotational velocity overall. Slight x/y-axis variations correlate with tilt initiation/recovery. The z-axis spike suggests a brief **twisting motion** during posture adjustment.  

**Key Insight**: Low gyroscope activity confirms **slow, controlled movement** (not rapid rotation), consistent with deliberate bending and straightening.

---

### **3. Magnetometer Analysis**
- **x-axis**:  
  - **Range**: Swings from **+5.37 µT** to **-5.44 µT**, indicating significant orientation shifts relative to Earth’s magnetic field.  
- **y/z-axis**:  
  - **y**: Consistently negative (-6 to -16 µT), aligning with torso alignment perpendicular to magnetic north.  
  - **z**: Strong negative baseline (-41 to -47 µT), typical of vertical alignment in Earth’s field.  

**Trend**: Magnetometer x-axis polarity reversal and y/z-axis fluctuations confirm **torso reorientation** (e.g., bending forward alters device alignment with magnetic field).

---

### **4. Activity Synthesis**
- **Primary Motion**: A **forward torso bend** (e.g., bowing, picking up an object) lasting ~3–4 seconds, followed by gradual return to upright posture.  
- **Sensor Correlations**:  
  - Accelerometer z-axis dip coincides with magnetometer x-axis polarity reversal (tilt-induced reorientation).  
  - Gyroscope spikes align with posture transitions (tilt initiation/recovery).

### **Summary of Trends**
| Sensor       | Key Trend                                  | Implication                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Accelerometer| z-axis dip to 1.25 m/s² + recovery        | Forward bending + posture recovery  |
| Gyroscope    | Low-magnitude fluctuations + z-axis spike | Controlled tilt with minor rotation |
| Magnetometer | x-axis polarity reversal + y/z shifts     | Torso reorientation relative to Earth’s field |

---

### **Conclusion**
The data reflects a **slow, controlled torso bend** with dynamic acceleration (z-axis), minor rotational adjustments (gyroscope), and magnetic field realignment. This matches activities like picking up an object, bowing, or transitioning between sitting and standing. The absence of high-frequency noise or periodic spikes rules out repetitive motions (e.g., walking)."

**Analysis:**  

### **1. Accelerometer Patterns**:  
- **X-axis**: The sharp spikes (e.g., **6.3 m/s²** at ~6s and **6.36 m/s²** at ~8s) align with sudden acceleration/deceleration events typical in a car (e.g., braking or rapid acceleration). Sustained fluctuations (4.2–5.8 m/s²) reflect moderate-speed driving.  
- **Y-axis**: Gradual decrease from **7.8 m/s²** to **6.6 m/s²** with erratic spikes (**8.96 m/s²**) suggests lateral forces during turns or lane changes.  
- **Z-axis**: The rise to **6.3 m/s²** followed by a drop to **2.1 m/s²** correlates with vertical motion from road irregularities (e.g., speed bumps or potholes).  

### **2. Gyroscope Activity**:  
- **Z-axis**: Sporadic yaw spikes (**0.28 rad/s**) indicate rotational changes in direction (e.g., steering).  
- **X/Y-axis**: Minor pitch/roll fluctuations (-0.37–0.27 rad/s) suggest subtle torso adjustments due to vehicle motion.  

### **3. Magnetometer Trends**:  
- **X-axis**: Polarity reversals (e.g., **-7.05 µT** to **2.05 µT**) confirm directional changes (e.g., turns or U-turns).  
- **Y/Z-axis**: Stable values (**-9.48 µT** and **-41 µT**) reflect consistent horizontal/vertical alignment relative to Earth’s field, ruling out erratic human motion (e.g., jumping).  

### **4. Exclusion of Other Activities**:  
- **Still**: High accelerometer variance and magnetometer reversals negate inactivity.  
- **Walking/Run**: Lack of periodic step signatures (e.g., rhythmic y-axis oscillations) and extreme z-axis drops (freefall-like) are inconsistent with gait.  
- **Car**: Matches all features—directional changes (magnetometer), acceleration spikes (X-axis), lateral forces (Y-axis), and vertical disturbances (Z-axis).
