1. Overall Magnitude of Acceleration Around Gravity: The acceleration signals hover near 9.8 m/s² in total, indicating no large shocks or impacts. This rules out the more vigorous activity of running (which typically shows higher amplitude swings) or the sharper bursts one might see when riding in a car on bumpy roads.

2. Subtle Yet Repeated Acceleration Variations: Although the accelerations remain fairly smooth, there are small but noticeable deviations and mild oscillations (±0.5 m/s²). These are consistent with gentle torso movements or steps rather than complete stillness. A fully “still” scenario would generally show even more stable readings with minimal fluctuations.

3. Modest Gyroscope Activity: The gyroscope data mostly lies near zero, with a few small spikes indicating mild turns or changes in orientation. This again suggests some ongoing body movement (e.g., slow steps or posture shifts), rather than remaining entirely stationary. Large or sustained angular changes (as might happen in running or fast turning) are absent.

4. Magnetometer Drifts: Gradual, moderate changes in the magnetometer readings support the notion of gentle phone orientation changes over time. There are no abrupt or extreme magnetic disturbances, so this does not suggest rapid movement or a car-like environment.

Putting these observations together, the data best matches slow, regular torso movements indicative of walking rather than being completely still, engaged in a run, or traveling in a car.",False
36,1498121573330.0,1498121583320.0,Still,Still,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude and Variation:
   - The acceleration values (x ≈ 4–4.6, y ≈ 8–8.3, z ≈ 2.2–2.4) remain fairly consistent and near a constant orientation offset from gravity. These levels suggest the device is oriented at an angle where gravity is distributed across X, Y, and Z. The changes are relatively small and primarily look like mild drifts or slight orientation shifts rather than the more periodic, stronger fluctuations expected from walking or running.

2) Gyroscope Readings are Small:
   - Gyroscope values mostly lie between −0.05 and +0.05 units. This indicates very little rotational movement overall (e.g., no sharp turns or continuous swinging motion). For walking or running, we often see more pronounced periodic rotation patterns (especially around the torso). For a car ride, there can be intermittent higher angular changes when turning. Here, everything remains quite subdued.

3) Lack of Step-like Oscillations:
   - Typical walking or running accelerations show a repetitive pattern with sharper up-down swings on at least one axis. Here, the X, Y, and Z accelerations do not exhibit that clear periodic “impact–swing–impact” pattern.
   - Even if the user were in a vehicle, the acceleration or gyroscope records might display occasional stronger jolts or directional changes. Instead, we see only gentle variations.

4) Magnetometer Changes, but Low Overall Movement:
   - The magnetometer readings do have some offsets and step-like shifts. However, these are more indicative of gradual heading/orientation changes or local magnetic interference, not the frequent or jarring changes usually observed if the user were in a moving vehicle.

5) Conclusion:
   - Taken together, the mostly constant accelerations, the very low angular rates in the gyroscope, and the relatively gentle magnetometer changes all signal minimal physical activity. This pattern aligns with a “Still” state: the torso/phone experiences small movements and slow orientation drifts rather than a sustained pattern of walking, running, or car driving.",True

1) Magnitude and fluctuations of accelerometer signals: The accelerometer readings hover consistently around values that align with normal gravity (with small variations at about 4 m/s² on the x-axis and ~8 m/s² on the y-axis, plus a few m/s² on the z-axis). There are no pronounced cyclical surges (as one might see in walking or running) and no large spikes (which might occur with more vigorous activity). 
2) Gyroscope behavior: The gyroscope signals remain low in amplitude with only modest changes, implying that the device (and thus the torso) did not rotate rapidly or continuously. This likewise argues against the repetitive motion of walking/running or the often more variable motion in a vehicle.
3) Overall consistency: The data exhibit relatively calm variations—no pronounced foot‐strike patterns (walking) or higher-impact signals (running). Meanwhile, typical car travel often introduces more distinct lateral accelerations or bursty changes (e.g., starting, stopping, or turning), which are not evident here.
4) Conclusion: The relatively steady readings and small fluctuations fit best with the user having remained essentially stationary, i.e., “Still,” rather than engaging in walking, running, or riding in a car.",True

These are neither as small and near-constant as one would expect if the user were completely still, nor as large and rapid as typical of running. Instead, they are in a moderate range, suggesting a steady, periodic movement such as walking. 2) Gyroscope Activity and Body Rotation: The gyroscope readings exhibit only small angular velocity bursts, staying mostly in the ±0.05–0.1 rad/s region. This indicates slow to moderate torso movement, which can naturally occur during normal walking strides, rather than the higher rotational rates one might see in running or making sharp turns in a car. 3) Magnetometer Stability: The magnetometer remains relatively stable with slow or modest heading changes. Such mild variations are consistent with normal changes in orientation while walking, rather than large or abrupt changes (e.g., vigorous running or rapid turns in a car). 4) Conclusion: Taken together, the moderate acceleration fluctuations, low-to-moderate gyro spikes, and mild magnetometer changes signify light-to-moderate human movement – most in line with a walking activity, rather than being still, running, or in a car.",False

Gyroscope readings show only small bursts of angular velocity, indicating mild torso shifts rather than continuous rotation or vigorous body movement.

The gyroscope readings stay near zero, with occasional minor spikes (~±0.3–0.4 rad/s), indicating gentle or slow torso/phone rotations rather than the sustained angular rates you would expect from active locomotion. Finally, the magnetometer measurements remain largely stable and negative on all three axes, suggesting the phone’s heading/orientation is not undergoing large turns or rapid changes (e.g., from cornering in a car). Altogether, these clues point to the user being mostly stationary (likely small posture shifts but no vigorous movement), which aligns best with the 'Still' label.",True
43,1498121643330.0,1498121653320.0,Still,Still,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude:
   • The three-axis accelerations hover in a range that sums to approximately one gravity (about 9.8 m/s²). They show small fluctuations but no pronounced cyclical pattern typical of walking or running. Nor are there prolonged larger accelerations that might be seen during car transit. The data mainly exhibit modest, short-lived deviations rather than strong or rhythmic spikes.

2) Gyroscope (Rotation Rate):
   • The gyro signals stay mostly within small angular velocity bounds, with values mostly under ±0.1–0.15. That indicates minimal rotational movement of the phone. Brief rotations appear, but they are mild and do not suggest the sustained or rhythmic torso motion you would expect in walking or running.

3) Magnetometer Stability:
   • The magnetometer readings remain relatively stable (drifting slowly but not showing large abrupt changes). This further supports minimal reorientation of the device over time.

4) Comparison to Activity Patterns:
   • Walking or running should produce a clear rhythmic acceleration pattern and more pronounced peaks in gyroscope readings due to the swinging motion of arms/torso.
   • Travel by car typically shows more steady acceleration changes, turning patterns, or vibrations. The provided data only indicate modest, infrequent shifts.
   • The signals here essentially show low-level fluctuations and small gyro changes, consistent with mostly “still” behavior (with some gentle shifts likely from minor torso movements).

44,1498121653330.0,1498121663320.0,Still,Walking,"Step by step, here is how we arrive at 'Walking':

1) Overall Magnitude of Acceleration: The accelerometer traces (especially X ~4.6–7+ at times, Y ~8±1, Z ~2–3) suggest constant gravitational components plus mild-to-moderate changes. These fluctuations are too large and frequent to be simply Still, yet not so intense or sustained as to indicate Running.

2) Moderate, Intermittent Peaks: The high-level description (e.g., gradual drift in X from ~4.6 toward 5–6+ with a few dips to ~3–4, and occasional bumps in Y and Z) points to a torso in mild motion—consistent with steps or short bursts of activity. By contrast, Running would typically show stronger, more rhythmic spikes, and Still would remain near constant or only slightly varying.

3) Limited Rotational Speed: The gyroscope signal remains low in amplitude (mostly ±0.1–0.15 or less). Walking generally produces moderate but not extreme rotations at the torso. These data do not show intense or prolonged angular velocities, making it unlike vigorous Running or frequent turning movements (e.g., repeated rapid rotations).

4) Inconsistent with Vehicle Patterns: The combination of moderate torso movements, small but noticeable acceleration peaks, and relatively tame rotations does not strongly match a Car scenario. Car travel often has longer periods of near-constant acceleration plus occasional distinct shifts when braking/turning, which are not emphasized here.

Putting these observations together, the most likely activity is “Walking.”",False

1) Overall acceleration magnitudes and fluctuations: The tri‐axis accelerations are dominated by what appears to be the gravitational component (roughly 4 g on x, 8 g on y, 3 g on z), with only small‐to‐moderate perturbations. This is not characteristic of repeated, stronger impacts or cyclical patterns (as would be expected for walking or running). Instead, the modest fluctuations suggest mild body sway or slight movements typical of quiet standing.

2) Gyroscope activity: The angular velocity measurements mostly stay within a low‐amplitude band (±0.05–0.1 or less), with only brief transient peaks. Walking or running usually induces a more pronounced repetitive rotational signature at the torso. The small, sporadic rotations here again favor a relatively stationary state.

3) Magnetometer drift: The magnetometer readings shift slowly over the 10 s window, reflecting slow changes in heading or minor phone orientation adjustments rather than abrupt turns or sustained directional changes (such as one might see in a moving car or during walking/running turns).

4) Comparison with activity categories: • Running would show larger, more rhythmic acceleration peaks. • Walking tends to have a more regular oscillatory pattern and moderate rotation changes. • Car travel often shows more varied acceleration changes (e.g., from starting, stopping, or turning). • Still is consistent with small variations in acceleration, small and infrequent gyroscopic bursts, and a slow magnetometer drift.

47,1498121683330.0,1498121693320.0,Still,Still,"Step by step, here is how we can arrive at 'Still':

1. Acceleration Magnitude and Variation: The accelerometer readings remain in relatively narrow bands (e.g., x-axis ∼3.9 g to 4.7 g, y-axis ∼7.8 g to 8.5 g, z-axis ∼2.4 g to 3.3 g) without large dynamic swings or spikes. Such steadiness is more consistent with standing or very gentle motion than with vigorous activities like running or riding in a car over bumps.

2. Low Rotational Rates: The gyroscope signals mostly stay within ±0.15–0.20 rad/s, indicating only mild or gradual turns. Walking, especially at a normal pace, tends to introduce slightly more pronounced regular angular patterns than is observed here, and running or riding in a turning car would typically show larger or more abrupt rotational changes.

3. Magnetometer Stability: The magnetometer axes remain negative and drift slowly by only small amounts, consistent with a fairly fixed orientation relative to Earth’s field. Large heading changes or jarring motions (e.g., from running or a car in traffic) would likely produce bigger reorientations.

",True
48,1498121693330.0,1498121703320.0,Still,Walking,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Overall acceleration magnitude and fluctuations:  
   • The accelerometer readings stay in moderate ranges (roughly 4–5.5 m/s² on x, ~8–9 m/s² on y, and ~2.5–3.5 m/s² on z) without large peaks. This suggests neither complete stillness (which would have very little variation) nor vigorous impacts (which would be more typical of running). Instead, mild but noticeable changes indicate moderate torso motion.

2. Gyroscope (angular velocity) trends:  
   • The gyro signals hover around small-to-moderate levels (mostly within ±0.2–0.5 rad/s) rather than spiking sharply. These gently changing angular velocities align with turning or twisting typical of walking, as opposed to the abrupt or high-speed rotations one might see in running or with very minimal rotation if one were completely still.

3. Magnetometer drift:  
   • The magnetometer axes shift significantly over the 10-second interval, moving from about −5…−20…−34 to the −30s or so. This may reflect the user changing heading or rotating while walking around. A comparatively large heading shift could happen if the user is casually changing direction.

4. Comparison with known activity patterns:  
   • Still/sedentary: Would show very little variation in the accelerometer and gyro data. Here there is enough fluctuation to rule out completely still behavior.
   • Running: Typically produces larger, sharper spikes in acceleration and more pronounced cyclical gyro peaks. That is not observed here.
   • Car travel: Often displays relatively smooth accelerometer patterns interrupted by acceleration/deceleration peaks (e.g., braking, turning). The moderate but steady footstep-like fluctuations here better match walking.
   • Walking: Matches well with the moderate, steady variations seen in both acceleration and rotation, as well as the gradual heading changes indicated by the magnetometer.

1) Overall Accelerometer Magnitudes: The accelerometer data shows values near 1 g (≈9.8 m/s²) when combining the three axes, with the Y-axis carrying much of the gravity component (≈8–9 m/s²) and the X- and Z-axes adding moderate variation. This suggests the phone is upright on the torso with a fairly steady orientation, but there are mild-to-moderate fluctuations in the X-axis (up to about 6 m/s² spikes) and smaller oscillations in Z.

2) Moderate Oscillations (Likely Steps): The pattern in the accelerometer data—particularly the moderate peaks and dips—indicates the presence of repeated, relatively rhythmic motion. That level of variation is common for walking, where each stride creates mild accelerations and decelerations in the torso.

3) Gyroscope Activity: The gyroscope readings remain mostly low, with short bursts rising to around ±0.2 rad/s. This matches gentle torso rotations (e.g., slight twisting or shifting) rather than large, forceful rotations one might see when running or performing high-intensity movements. It also differs from a “still” scenario, because there is some evident rotational activity corresponding to mild, repeated motion.

4) Comparison to Other Activities:
   • Still: Would show near-constant acceleration near gravity with minimal variation and negligible gyroscope activity, which is not the case here.
   • Running: Tends to produce higher-amplitude accelerometer fluctuations and more pronounced cyclical gyroscope patterns.
   • Car: Can sometimes resemble stillness (if the ride is very smooth) or show more erratic, higher bursts of lateral acceleration when braking or turning. The moderate, wave-like torso accelerations seen here, however, more closely fit walking.

Given these moderate torso accelerations with wave-like oscillations, small-to-moderate gyroscope rotation bursts, and an otherwise relatively stable orientation, the most consistent activity is Walking.",False

1. Overall low/mild accelerations: The accelerometer readings stay near values attributable to gravity (around 4 m/s² in x, 8+ m/s² in y, ~3 m/s² in z) with no strong or rapid swings in magnitude. This indicates no significant translational accelerations that would be characteristic of walking, running, or driving.

2. Minimal sustained rhythmic movement: A person who is walking or running generally exhibits a cyclical or periodic pattern in accelerometer data. Here, there is no clear repetitive pattern of footfalls (which typically appear as consistent spikes or oscillations). The data remain fairly constant, suggesting the user is not engaged in sustained locomotion.

3. Short rotation at the end: The gyroscope data show small angular rates for most of the recording and only a noticeable rotation spike in the final seconds (up to ~0.3–0.5 rad/s). This likely reflects the phone being physically rotated or repositioned rather than a sustained motion characteristic of driving (where additional, smaller vibrations and inertial changes might appear over time).

4. Consistency with being stationary: The limited, mostly low-level gyroscope activity (except for that brief rotation), along with accelerometer signals that hover around gravity without significant variance, aligns best with a ""Still"" scenario rather than the more dynamic ""Walking,"" ""Run,"" or ""Car"" patterns.

1. Overall Acceleration Levels: The accelerations in X can briefly exceed 5–6 g, while Y-axis readings consistently hover in the 8–9 g range with bursts near 10 g. Such high-magnitude peaks go well beyond the low-intensity signals one would see in gentle activities (e.g., Still or easy Walking). They are more characteristic of high-impact foot strikes. 

2. Axis-by-Axis Patterns:
   • X-Axis: Sustained values around 3–4 g with dips (~2 g) and spikes above 5 g. These repeated surges often arise when the torso moves sharply—typical during running footfalls.  
   • Y-Axis: Near 8–9 g much of the time (the orientation suggests the phone’s y-axis is partially “loaded” by gravity), with periodic peaks to about 10 g. Such strong peaks, again, suggest the person’s body is undergoing high-impact accelerations, such as in running strides.
   • Z-Axis: Remains in a moderate band (2.5–3.5 g) with fewer large fluctuations. In running, one axis often exhibits smaller dynamic changes if that axis is less directly impacted by foot-strike shocks.

3. Gyroscope Observations: The angular velocities generally stay near zero with modest bursts (approaching ±0.7–1.0 rad/s). Running often involves vertical/horizontal jolts rather than large continuous rotations; therefore, the moderate gyro signals also align with typical torso motion while running.

4. Eliminating Other Activities:
   • Still: Would show near-constant ~1 g (plus minor noise), nowhere near 6–10 g.
   • Walking: Usually peaks are more modest (2–3 g), well below the consistent 5–10 g seen here.
   • Car: While a very bumpy car ride might produce bursts, sustaining frequent shocks in the 6–10 g range is unlikely; typical in-vehicle vibrations are much lower.

Putting these patterns together, the repeatedly high acceleration bursts (especially near 10 g along one axis) are most indicative of high-impact footfalls, which is characteristic of the person running.",False

1) Overall Accelerations: The accelerometer ranges and description indicate moderate movement but not a sustained high‐acceleration pattern. Specifically, the acceleration data show values largely in a moderate band, with occasional bursts toward 8–9 m/s² on X and Y. Such intermittent spikes are more characteristic of steps (footfalls) and body shifts typical of walking, rather than the very high and repetitive surges seen in running or the near-constant lower dynamics of sitting still.

2) Gyroscope Magnitude: The gyroscope signal suggests mild-to-moderate torso rotations. While it is not completely still (which would indicate a stationary user), it also is not extreme enough to suggest the constant twisting or rapid pivots often associated with running. The observed angular rates, typically in the tens of °/s (or up to ~0.7–0.9 rad/s in short bursts), align with torso turns/rotations that occur during normal walking.

3) Magnetometer Variation: Although magnetic disturbances and orientation changes affect all four activity types, the relatively continuous heading/orientation shifts suggest the user is moving about in a manner consistent with walking, turning, or navigating typical spaces (not just standing or driving, which could produce different or more stable patterns).

4) Comparison with Still, Run, and Car: (a) Still would show nearly flat acceleration/gyroscope patterns (no significant bursts or repeated step-like fluctuations). (b) Running typically features higher, more repetitive impacts in the accelerometer (often >1g in repeated spikes) and more pronounced torso rotation rates. (c) Riding in a car tends to show smoother or more irregularly timed accelerations from vehicle motion, often combined with occasional large spikes when turning/accelerating, rather than the rhythmic pattern indicative of steps. The moderate, step-like bursts here are more consistent with walking.

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude & Patterns: The accelerometer readings show a baseline in the neighborhood of (X≈5, Y≈8, Z≈2–3) m/s², which already splits gravity unevenly among axes. Importantly, there are repeated surges in the 7–10+ m/s² range (particularly on X and Y) rather than staying near an almost-fixed value (as in standing still) or consistently high values (as in running where acceleration spikes would be more intense and more frequent). This moderate but repeated peaking is characteristic of a walking motion.
2) Gyroscope Spikes: The gyroscope is often near small angular rates (≤ 0.1 rad/s) with short-lived bumps. During running, one would usually observe larger, more continuous angular fluctuations due to more vigorous torso oscillations. In a car, many intervals can be very steady (especially at cruising speed) with abrupt spikes mostly during acceleration/braking, but the accelerometer would look different (often with spikes aligned primarily along one axis). The observed short bursts of low-to-moderate angular rates suggest torso rotations typical of footstep-induced sway.
3) Still vs. More Active: The data clearly rule out a purely still activity because the accelerometer never settles to a stable baseline; there are too many mid-range spikes. Likewise, the pattern of moderate spikes (in both accelerometer and gyroscope) rather than continuous high-magnitude motion also distinguishes walking from running.
4) Magnetometer Drifts: While relevant for orientation changes, they do not by themselves identify the specific activity. However, turns and heading shifts are consistent with normal walking dynamics, and the gradual shifts reinforce the idea that the person is on foot, occasionally changing direction.

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude and Peaks: The accelerometer shows moderate fluctuations (around 4–6 m/s²) with a few larger spikes up to approximately 7–9 m/s² on the X-axis. Such bursts are consistent with footfalls or periodic slight impacts indicative of walking (rather than being mostly still or having very high-impact forces that would suggest running).
2) Gravity Orientation and Moderate Movement: The persistent ~9 m/s² offset on the accelerometer’s Y-axis indicates the device orientation is such that gravity is dominantly captured there. The additional superimposed variations and occasional peaks in X and Z suggest a dynamic but not extreme movement pattern (more characteristic of walking than standing still or driving in a car, which often have smoother or different acceleration signatures).
3) Gyroscope Spikes without Sustained Rotation: The gyroscope data shows moderate repeated peaks (±0.1 to ±0.7 rad/s), implying there are intermittent torso rotations, likely from natural turning movements during walking. There is no large continuous angular velocity that might appear in vigorous activity (e.g., intense exercise) or frequent car turns.
4) Magnetometer Drifts: The changing magnetometer readings point to changes in heading and tilt, consistent with a person moving through space on foot (turning in small increments) rather than staying stationary or undergoing only modest orientation changes (such as might occur if sitting in a vehicle).
5) Mild-to-Moderate Activity Level: Synthesizing these cues—the moderate acceleration peaks, repeated short gyroscope spikes, and overall dynamic pattern over 10 seconds—best aligns with a walking activity rather than being completely still (too many bursts), running (peak accelerations typically higher), or a car ride (the cyclical foot impact profile would be less pronounced).",False

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude and Patterns: The accelerometer’s X-axis rises from roughly 3–4 m/s² up to about 7 m/s², then oscillates in a band of roughly 3–7 m/s². That kind of range—moderate but clearly varying—often corresponds to the up-down or forward-back motions of walking steps, as opposed to the higher, more forceful peaks typically seen in running or the comparatively more constant/less‑oscillatory readings in a car. Meanwhile, the Y-axis remains near gravitational levels (~9 m/s²) for some periods but dips transiently to 6–7 m/s², suggesting body/phone tilt with each stride. The Z-axis is at or near zero for a while but has repeated climbs into the midrange (4–6 m/s²) and sometimes higher, again hinting step-like vertical jostling.

2) Rotation (Gyroscope) Cues: Although there are bursts up to a few tenths of a rad/s (and in some instances 0.5–0.7), the angular rates are not consistently high enough to suggest rapid, vigorous movements (like running), nor are they minimal or very steady (like sitting still). The observed moderate spikes align well with turning motions or torso roll/pitch while walking.

3) Magnetometer Variation: The recorded magnetometer axes show gradual or stepwise shifts, consistent with heading/orientation changes that might occur with normal walking. They do not reflect a largely steady orientation (as might be expected if sitting still or traveling smoothly in a car) nor the more chaotic heading changes that might come from very fast or erratic motion.

4) Excluding Other Activities:
   • Still: The data are clearly not still—there are large accelerometer swings and rotational bursts.
   • Run: Running typically produces larger, more frequent accelerometer peaks and faster repetitive cycles. Here, the acceleration peaks (around 7 m/s²) and moderate gyroscope spikes better match walking.
   • Car: Car travel often shows smoother accelerations interspersed with braking/turning events rather than a regular, repeated step-like pattern; also the device’s gravity axis orientation would usually remain more stable if simply resting in a car. The data show stronger periodic variations indicative of locomotive steps.

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude and Variation: The accelerometer shows the phone is mostly oriented so that the Y‑axis carries gravity (~9 m/s²), but X‑axis values rise gradually from around 3 m/s² to peaks around 5–6 m/s² toward the end. This indicates a moderate forward/backward tilt or motion, larger than a completely stationary posture yet not as large or repetitive as one would expect from running (which typically shows higher peak accelerations and a more cyclical pattern).
2) Gyroscope Activity: Early gyroscope readings hover near zero (little rotation), followed by modest spikes (±0.05–0.08 rad/s). These are stronger than a still posture but remain moderate compared to running or vigorous car motions. These smaller, short-duration angular changes are consistent with the torso rotating gently during walking.
3) No Strong Evidence of Car-Like or High-Speed Signals: A passenger in a car might show sharper turns or steadier but larger overall accelerations from vehicular motions (often with sudden lateral or forward/back accelerations at times). The data does not strongly reflect those patterns.
4) Not Completely Still: The late increase in X‑axis acceleration (to ~5–6 m/s²) and corresponding small but noticeable gyroscope spikes suggest the user is walking rather than standing still.

Given these moderate but clearly present movements in acceleration and rotation—larger than mere sway while standing, but not as high-amplitude or periodic as a run—the activity aligns most closely with Walking.",False

They are more consistent with a moderate, repeated oscillatory pattern rather than the very low/flat profile of 'Still' or the large, abrupt changes typical of 'Run.' 2) The gyroscope measurements remain under about ±0.3–0.4 rad/s and frequently hover near zero, indicating only mild torso rotation—enough to be consistent with walking steps but not the more vigorous twists or higher rates usually seen in running. 3) The moderate but repeated accelerometer waveforms in the Z-axis (crossing around zero) are characteristic of small vertical or forward-back body displacements (footsteps).

1) Overall motion intensity: The accelerometer values generally hover between about 4–8 m/s², with occasional brief spikes but no extremely large peaks. This moderate amplitude is more consistent with walking than with standing still (which would show near-constant acceleration close to gravity, with little variation) or running (which would typically produce higher and more abrupt spikes). The gyroscope, remaining mostly around ±0.05 to ±0.3 rad/s, also indicates moderate rotation without the brisk, repetitive swings typical of running.

2) Distinguishing from 'Still': Even though the average accelerations hover below 9.81 m/s², there are frequent fluctuations (e.g., short bursts and variation in the x and y channels by 1–2 m/s²). This would not match a 'Still' scenario, where the phone would show relatively stable readings near gravity and minimal spikes.

3) Distinguishing from 'Run': The data does not show the characteristic large, periodic acceleration peaks typical of running, nor do the gyroscope readings suggest strong, repetitive torso rotations.

4) Distinguishing from 'Car': In-vehicle data often has segments of smoother acceleration (particularly if driving steadily) interspersed with more sudden changes when accelerating or braking. The described moderate, fairly continuous torso-level movement and the relatively small but ongoing gyroscope variations are more consistent with a person physically walking and turning rather than sitting in a car.

5) Heading/orientation changes: The magnetometer readings undergo distinct shifts, suggesting the person turns or changes direction more than once. Such gradual re-orientations fit normal walking behavior, where one might pivot or take short turns.

Together, these moderate, sustained fluctuations in the accelerometer plus the low-to-moderate rotational rates on the gyroscope and the magnetometer’s orientation changes point to the individual being in a walking activity.",False

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitudes and Patterns:
   – Each axis (x, y, z) shows relatively narrow ranges (x ≈ 5.5–6.2 m/s², y ≈ 7.5–8.2 m/s², z ≈ −1.4 to −0.3 m/s²) with gentle undulations. These moderate variations often occur when a torso-mounted device experiences small but regular shifts (e.g., mild stepping motion), as opposed to being completely stationary (which would show even smaller variations) or running (where larger peaks/spikes typically appear at step frequency).

2) Gyroscope Signals:
   – The angular velocities remain near zero with only brief, small pulses (on the order of 0.02–0.08 rad/s). This indicates minimal rotation of the torso over time, which aligns more with walking (often subdued torso rotation) than running (more vigorous rotational components) or being in a fast-moving vehicle (potentially steadier or more abrupt rotations during turns/acceleration).

3) Lack of Large Spikes or High-frequency Shocks:
   – Neither the accelerometer nor the gyroscope data suggests forceful impacts or abrupt changes typical of running (which shows higher acceleration spikes at each footfall) or driving in a car (which often has noticeable acceleration changes around starts/stops and turns). The modest oscillations fit a slow-to-moderate cadence consistent with walking steps.

4) Magnetometer Drifts:
   – Gradual magnetometer heading changes point to small orientation shifts, typical of normal turning or slight movements while walking, rather than large, steady changes or remaining almost perfectly constant (as might happen if stationary with minimal phone torque).

Taking all these points together, the most probable activity is gentle Walking.",False

1. Overall Acceleration Magnitudes and Fluctuations:
   • The acceleration signals (particularly x around 5 m/s², y around 8 m/s², and z near -0.5 m/s²) remain relatively stable but show small, repeated variations. These modest but noticeable fluctuations typically occur when a person is taking steps or shifting posture rather than remaining completely still or moving very vigorously.
   • Brief increases toward 6 m/s², plus occasional dips on the z-axis below -1 m/s², suggest periodic impacts or small transitions consistent with walking steps (rather than the larger swings expected of running or the near-constant values of stationary behavior).

2. Gyroscope Activity:
   • The gyroscope data remains in relatively low angular rate ranges for much of the time, with occasional short bursts. Such moderate rotational changes often occur during torso twists or arm/shoulder turns in normal walking.
   • There is no sustained, high-amplitude rotation indicative of strenuous or explosive activity (like running with arms pumping vigorously), nor is there very little/no rotation that would align with being completely still.

3. Magnetometer Variations:
   • The magnetometer readings change in blocks, suggesting the user changes orientation relative to the Earth’s magnetic field—e.g., turning corners or adjusting heading. These turns are common in light locomotion (such as walking from one place to another) and slightly reorienting the torso.
   • In a car scenario, large heading changes might also occur, but the acceleration and gyroscope signals for in-vehicle travel tend to have different signatures (e.g., faster linear accelerations/braking, or more uniform curves at constant speeds on smooth roads). The described mild, periodic variations here more closely match footsteps than typical driving patterns.

4. Conclusion:
   • Taken together, these factors—gentle but periodic accelerometer fluctuations, moderate gyroscope changes, and stepwise magnetometer shifts—are most consistent with a walking activity. The signals are neither too small (still) nor intense enough (running) nor do they exhibit the distinctive driving patterns. Thus, “Walking” is the best match.",False

1) Acceleration Magnitudes and Pattern:
   • The accelerometer readings in X and Y remain relatively high (≈5–6 m/s² on X, ≈8 m/s² on Y) because gravity is distributed mostly along those axes due to the phone’s orientation on the torso.
   • The Z-axis varies from slightly negative (around −0.2 m/s²) up to positive values exceeding +1 m/s². Although not extreme, these fluctuations suggest ongoing mild periodic motion (likely the up/down or tilt oscillations each step).
   • True “still” would exhibit near-constant acceleration in all axes without that wavelike variation. Conversely, “run” would typically show higher amplitude and a more pronounced, faster repeating pattern.
   • Driving in a car can exhibit more irregular or larger bursts of acceleration (e.g., from braking, turning) or be quite smooth at speed, but usually combines noticeable horizontal changes with road vibrations. Here, the mild, gently oscillatory nature aligns more with walking.

2) Gyroscope (Angular Rates):
   • All gyro axes remain relatively small (on the order of ±0.1–0.3 rad/s spikes), implying moderate sway or rotation but no large, sustained pivots.
   • A gentle, rhythmic angular motion is consistent with steps and torso sway while walking. Running often has greater rotational bursts; driving may also involve steering/turning surges.

3) Magnetometer:
   • Readings remain fairly stable overall, with only gradual drifts. This indicates no large heading changes (e.g., no repeated turning in place or consistent rotating as in very dynamic activity).

4) Overall Conclusion:
   • The moderate up/down Z oscillations, small but repeated gyro excursions, and stable but slightly undulating magnetometer together suggest a mild repetitive motion typical of walking. The changes are more pronounced than simply standing still, yet not large enough to indicate running or strong vehicle movements.

   – The accelerometer’s Y‐axis often centers near gravity (~9.8 m/s²) but in this data it clearly peaks around 15–17 m/s² at multiple points. Such high excursions above gravity typically indicate intense impacts or foot strikes, more characteristic of running than walking (which usually shows more moderate peaks).

2) Signal Range Across Axes
   – On the X‐ and Z‐axes, there are repeated swings and bursts (e.g., 6–8 m/s² on X and dips near −3 m/s² on Z). These bursts and oscillations align with vigorous torso movements.

3) Gyroscope Activity
   – The gyroscope shows moderate to occasionally larger (±1 rad/s) rotations, consistent with an active motion where the torso is rotating in short bursts. While walking can produce some rotation, the combination of higher accelerations plus these rotations suggests a more vigorous gait such as running.

These amplitudes far exceed typical walking accelerations (usually a few g’s at most) and strongly suggest a more vigorous, high‐impact activity. 2) The Z‐axis shows repeated sharp negative dips (down to −6 g), also pointing to strong, repeated bouncing motions consistent with running strides rather than the more moderate oscillations of walking. 3) The gyroscope readings show moderate angular rates (hovering around ±1 rad/s), indicative of torso rotations that accompany a more dynamic gait (running) rather than a slow pace or a still condition. 4) The magnetometer remains largely negative but does not provide the main clue for categorizing the activity; rather, it corroborates that the phone underwent orientation changes without large magnetic spikes that might suggest a stationary device. 5) Altogether, these strong, cyclical bursts at high acceleration levels, combined with moderate rotational rates, align well with a running gait rather than a slower walk, a stationary posture, or typical vehicle motion.",False

1. Overall Signal Magnitudes and Regularity:
   • The accelerometer shows a strong gravity component (~9–10 m/s²) on one axis, indicating the phone is upright on the torso. Superimposed on gravity are frequent, relatively large dynamic accelerations (some 12 m/s² or more). This magnitude of repeated peaks is often more consistent with running or other vigorous activity than with slow walking or stillness.

2. Acceleration Peaks and Rhythmic Bursts:
   • The periodic rises and dips in the accelerometer (e.g., up to ~12–15 m/s² on the y‐axis, and ±9–10 m/s² on x/z) suggest higher‐impact, cyclical footfalls. Walking tends to produce lower‐peak accelerations, whereas running/jogging generates larger, sharper peaks.

3. Gyroscope Activity:
   • The gyroscope data displays modest angular velocities most of the time, but with noticeable rotation bursts. For running, one typically sees episodes of extra torso rotation or bouncing, though not necessarily extreme. The presence of periodic moderate bursts (up to about ±1.5 rad/s) aligns with arm/torso movement that can occur during a run.

4. Excluding Other Categories:
   • 'Still' is ruled out because of the repeated, relatively large dynamic accelerations.
   • 'Walking' typically has smaller amplitude in both accelerometer and gyroscope signals, with fewer peaks reaching 12–15 m/s².
   • 'Car' motion can sometimes produce vibrations, but it rarely shows the strongly cyclical, high‐impact pattern observed here and usually has lower and more irregular torso acceleration if the phone is just resting.

A ‘Car’ ride typically produces smoother changes over time with some bumps or turns, but the often-repeated, more rhythmic bursts in these data suggest a repetitive human motion rather than road/vehicle vibrations. 2) Between ‘Walking’ and ‘Run,’ running typically generates higher and more frequent abrupt acceleration peaks, sometimes exceeding 10 m/s² and showing larger swings, which matches many of the acceleration extremes (some readings near or above 12 m/s², and even higher spikes noted on the y-axis). 3) The gyroscope data also shows intervals punctuated by brief, more intense rotations, consistent with quick torso movement during running strides. 4) Overall, the presence of repeated large transients (in both positive and negative directions) alongside moderate-to-strong gyroscope spikes supports a “Run” label more than a gentle or slower-paced walk.",False

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude: The raw accelerometer data shows multiple spikes well above 5 g and extending into the range of 15–20 g on the Y-axis (and 7–8 g on the X-axis). Such high peaks are indicative of very forceful or impact-driven movements, which typically exceed the levels one would see in 'Still,' 'Walking,' or normal driving in a 'Car.'

2) Repeated Vigorous Bursts: In the description, there are repeated bursts of high amplitude accelerations followed by moderate intervals. This pattern is consistent with a stride-like, cyclical motion that involves strong impacts, such as running. Walking usually has peaks but of much lower amplitude (often in the 2–5 g range), and car travel tends not to produce repeated 15–20 g spikes unless there is extreme off-road or crash-like activity.

3) Gyroscope Trends: The gyroscope signals show moderate rotational activity and some distinct spikes. While these rotations exist in all dynamic activities, the strong accelerations combined with moderate rotational changes support a physically vigorous activity—again pointing more toward running than walking or stillness.

4) Magnetometer Shifts: The magnetometer readings show orientation changes (step-like changes and drifts), consistent with torso rotation in a free-moving activity. This complements the strong accelerations, reinforcing that the person is actively moving (rather than sitting in a vehicle where orientation changes would usually be smoother and less forceful).

This level is more in line with walking rather than the faster rotational dynamics and higher impact that might accompany running. 4) Steady Magnetometer: The magnetometer remains relatively stable with only slow to moderate heading changes, again fitting typical walking movement rather than erratic orientation shifts or large heading changes that might suggest another mode of travel.

1. Overall Acceleration Amplitudes: The X-axis routinely spikes well above 7 g (e.g., 7–9 g or more). Sustained peaks above roughly 6–7 g tend to indicate stronger foot impacts than typical walking—often associated with running or very vigorous motion.

2. Quasi-periodic Sharp Bursts: The acceleration signals (especially on X and Y) show repeated cycles of high-amplitude spikes. These are characteristic of foot strikes or impacts at a higher rate than normal walking.

3. Gyroscope Activity: While there are moderate rotational bursts, there is no indication of protracted spinning or slow, steady turning (which might be seen if seated in a vehicle or performing slow movements). Instead, the data shows intermittent, moderate spikes—consistent with torso twisting as one runs.

1) Overall Signal Magnitudes: In the middle of the record (roughly 4–7 s), the accelerometer x- and y-axes frequently spike above 10 m/s², sometimes into the mid-teens. Such large bursts of acceleration, combined with noticeable peaks in the gyroscope, point to more vigorous body movements than would be typical of walking.

2) Mid-Record Bursts: Both the accelerometer and gyroscope have their strongest activity in the mid-portion of the data. Walking usually produces smaller, steadier fluctuations (often under about 10 m/s² for a torso-mounted device), whereas running can generate higher‑magnitude peaks due to stronger impacts each stride. The mid-teens accelerations and pronounced angular velocity surges are more consistent with running.

3) Not Consistent with “Still” or “Car”: The data clearly shows dynamic movement, so “Still” is ruled out. While a car ride can have bursts of acceleration (e.g., braking, turning, bumps), the pattern described (sustained, repetitive higher-magnitude motions around 4–7 s, then tapering) more closely resembles human locomotion steps than sporadic vehicular accelerations.

1. Overall Movement vs. Stillness:
   The accelerometer shows continuous, pronounced fluctuations (e.g., X and Y up to about 8–9 m/s² and often beyond 13–15 m/s² for Y). These bursts rule out 'Still' since there is clearly nontrivial torso motion throughout the 10 s.

2. Acceleration Magnitude and Pattern:
   • The repeated high spikes in the X-axis (often 8–9 m/s² or higher) and in the Y-axis (routinely above about 13–15 m/s², occasionally up to 17+) indicate vigorous vertical/forward motion. Walking typically produces smaller amplitude variations, while running tends to show higher and more frequent peaks.
   • The Z-axis also exhibits strong positive surges and negative dips, suggesting significant up/down torso movement.

3. Gyroscope Indicators:
   • There are moderate rotational rates on the X and Y axes (pitch and roll), consistent with repeated torso rocking or bounding. Running often yields stronger torso rotations than gentle walking.
   • The moderate angular speed clusters match a cadence-like pattern—in running, the phone (attached to the torso) undergoes repeated pitching/rolling cycles that align with footfalls.

4. Contrasting with Car Motion:
   • During typical, steady car travel, accelerations often concentrate on one axis during starts/stops or turns, with less regular stepping-like periodicity. Here, the data shows a well-defined, repeated cyclical nature (torso movement) rather than random automotive accelerations.

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude: The raw acceleration repeatedly reaches very high peaks (e.g., 12–13 m/s², even up to ~20 m/s² on the Y-axis). These strong surges and spikes are more than one would typically observe in gentle walking or sitting still. Walking can produce moderate peaks above the baseline of gravity, but reaching ~15–20 m/s² strongly suggests a higher-intensity activity such as running.

2) Cyclic “Impact” Signatures: In the acceleration data, there are clear burst/impact-like patterns returning to a moderate baseline (~2–5 m/s²) and then surging again. This kind of repeated “footfall impact” signature—where peaks occur regularly and fairly frequently—is characteristic of running strides, whereas still or slow walking has fewer/lower peaks.

3) Gyroscope Spikes Are Present but Not Extreme: The gyroscope data shows moderate angular velocity with bursts around ±1–1.5 rad/s. This indicates torso rotations or jolts that are noticeable but not excessively large. During running, one often sees moderate, periodic angular changes (torso pitch/roll) but not as high as in certain rapid twisting motions.

4) Contrast with Other Activities:
   • Still: Would not show such consistently high or frequent acceleration spikes.
   • Walking: Typically lower acceleration peaks (often < 15 m/s²) and a slower stepping frequency.
   • Car: Acceleration might show bursts when braking/turning, but the very regular, high-amplitude “impact” pattern here is more consistent with foot-strike impacts.

   - The y-axis hovers around 10–16 m/s², meaning that gravity (~9.8 m/s²) plus body movement is producing periodic peaks above 1 g. This again suggests footstep impacts or similar.

   - The signals show clear periodicity that aligns with step-like motion rather than being nearly flat (which would be “Still”) or containing large, high-frequency impacts often exceeding 2 g or more (which would be more indicative of a run).
   - The moderate amplitude (peaks around ~10 m/s² to ~11 m/s²) can certainly occur in brisk walking, especially when the phone is torso-mounted.

3. Gyroscope Amplitudes:
   - Most gyro values stay within ±1 rad/s, with no sustained high angular velocity. Running often shows more pronounced torso rotation (especially up and down pitching), whereas here it is moderate.
   - The low to moderate angular rates are typical of walking, as there is some rotation with each step but not a large or abrupt spinning.

4. Magnetometer Stability:
   - The magnetometer readings are fairly steady and consistently negative, changing only slightly—implying a relatively stable orientation with small heading changes. This also fits with walking, where the phone orientation is not rapidly or wildly changing (as might be the case in a vehicle making sharp turns or in a more vigorous activity).

5. Conclusion:
   - Compared against the categories Still, Walking, Run, and Car, these data most closely fit moderate, periodic stepping with moderate accelerations and moderate gyro activity—i.e., “Walking.”",True

This amplitude and periodicity go beyond what is expected for either walking (usually lower peaks, closer to 2–8 m/s² overall) or a still posture (minimal fluctuations). The gyroscope signals show moderate but not extreme rotational velocities, suggesting active but not erratic torso rotation—again consistent with a running stride pattern rather than the more random or smooth acceleration profiles seen in driving. Accordingly, these combined observations point to “Run” as the most likely activity.",False

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude and Pattern:
   • The Y-axis peaks around 15–16 m/s² (and similarly large swings in X and negative Z values), which is generally higher than typical walking forces (often topping around 10–12 m/s²). These strong peaks suggest more intense, repetitive impacts consistent with running.
   • The Z-axis shows frequent dips to −6 or −7 m/s² in a rhythmic pattern, implying repeated vertical impacts (footfalls) that are more pronounced during running than during a slower walk.

2) Gyroscope Readings:
   • Although the angular velocity remains mostly below ±1 rad/s, there are brief spikes indicating moderate torso rotation or bouncing. While walking also has some rotation, the pronounced repetitive acceleration surges align better with running.

3) Unlikelihood of Other Categories:
   • Still: Disqualified by the large-amplitude accelerations and repeated rhythmic pattern.
   • Car: Acceleration in a car is typically smoother (with spikes mainly from turning, braking, or potholes) rather than the strong, rhythmic “foot-strike” pattern.
   • Walking: Could produce a similar pattern but usually with smaller amplitude peaks (fewer values in the 15–16 m/s² range). The consistently high acceleration bursts are more characteristic of a running stride.

These surges exceed what one would normally expect in gentle or moderate walking, indicating higher-impact footfalls. 2) The y-axis baseline is around 9–11 m/s² (close to 1 g) but spikes up toward 14–16 m/s² multiple times, suggesting repeated vertical impacts consistent with running strides. 3) The z-axis also swings from negative (around −9 m/s²) to positive values, hinting at significant up-and-down or forward-back torso motion—again in line with running’s more forceful steps rather than the smaller oscillations typical of walking. 4) The gyroscope data remain mostly within about ±1 rad/s, indicating moderate but repeated rotational changes; this also fits running, where the torso rotates with each stride but does not spin wildly. 5) “Still” is ruled out by the large, recurring accelerations; “Car” typically shows a different pattern (smooth cruising punctuated by turns/bumps rather than a regular foot-impact cycle).

1. Acceleration Magnitude & Periodicity:  
   • The accelerometer data shows a baseline near gravity (≈9–10 m/s² on the Y-axis) plus repeated spikes into the 14–15 m/s² range. These peaks are large enough to indicate stepping motion but not so high as to suggest vigorous running.  
   • The presence of a clear cyclical pattern (rises and falls in acceleration) further supports a gait-like activity (footsteps), which points toward walking or running. However, the amplitude here, while noticeable, is still more characteristic of walking than of a full run (which can produce even larger and more frequent acceleration spikes).

2. Gyroscope Activity:  
   • The gyroscope data shows moderate, short bursts of angular velocity (on the order of ±1 rad/s). In running, one often sees stronger or more frequent torso rotations because the upper body moves more forcefully. Here, the rotations are only moderate, compatible with normal walking motions and occasional turns.

3. Magnetometer Trends:  
   • The magnetometer readings mostly exhibit slow drifts and slight plateaus, consistent with gradual changes in orientation as a person walks and occasionally turns. In a car, one might see steadier orientation changes (or abrupt large turns), and for a still position, the magnetic readings would be quite stable.

4. Elimination of Other Activities:  
   • Still: The repeated cyclical accelerations and moderate gyroscope bursts rule out a still activity.  
   • Run: Running typically has higher, more frequent accelerometric peaks and often larger rotational rates; these data are strong but do not consistently reach the high amplitudes typical of running.  
   • Car: While being in a vehicle can create some vibration patterns, the strong, regular step-like cycles seen here (and moderate torso rotation) are not characteristic of driving.

1) Overall Motion Magnitude: The accelerometer signals reach into the low-to-mid teens (m/s²) on the y‑axis (often 12–14 m/s², with occasional peaks above 14). Typical “light” walking often shows somewhat lower peak accelerations. Values of ~12–14 m/s² (i.e., exceeding 1 g) more strongly indicate a higher‐intensity stride pattern consistent with running or jogging.

2) Oscillatory Pattern in Accelerations: The x‑ and y‑axes show repeated, pulse-like peaks, with z-axis sign changes (from negative to positive) in sync. Such a pronounced up–down torso motion is characteristic of gait cycles, but the amplitude (and more vigorous nature) favors running over walking.

3) Moderate Gyroscope Ranges: The angular rates (~±1 rad/s or less) are neither very low (which might be seen if still or seated in a car) nor extremely high (e.g., vigorous torso twisting), but sufficient to suggest an active gait. This aligns with moderate rotational movement typical of running strides.

4) Not Car or Still: The large, periodic surges in the accelerations and moderate angular velocities rule out a still or in‐car scenario (those would show more uniform or different acceleration/gyro profiles). The data clearly capture sustained repetitive movement.

5) Conclusion: The combination of repeated, higher‐amplitude accelerations (regularly crossing 10 m/s² and occasionally exceeding 14 m/s²) plus moderate gyro activity fits best with running (a more vigorous locomotor activity) among the given categories (Still, Walking, Run, Car).",False

1) Overall Motion vs. Still: The accelerometer signals clearly show large, repetitive, wave-like fluctuations on all three axes (with values often well above 9.8 m/s²). In a 'Still' scenario, accelerations would remain nearly constant around gravity (≈9.8 m/s²) with minimal variation. Hence, the data do not reflect a 'Still' activity.

2) Rhythm and Cyclical Nature: Both the x- and y-axis accelerations reach into ranges of 10–15 m/s² (and sometimes beyond), with noticeable oscillations at a regular pace. This indicates a repeated pattern typical of steps or strides, rather than the flatter, less-variable accelerations one might see from smoother vehicular travel.

3) Comparing Walking vs. Running: While walking also produces cyclical patterns, the peak-to-peak accelerations here (up to ~15 m/s² in some axes) and the pronounced negative dips/positive peaks observed in the data are more intense than typical walking footsteps. These higher-amplitude bursts usually occur when running or jogging, due to a greater vertical displacement and impact forces.

4) Gyroscope Readings: The moderate angular velocity spikes corroborate torso rotation/swinging consistent with running. Walking would likely yield lower amplitude rotational bursts. Meanwhile, the gyroscope data are not overwhelmingly large (e.g., multiple radians/sec), so the rotations appear typical of an active human running rather than a rapid machine-based or vehicle-based motion.

5) Excluding Car Travel: In a car, accelerations often show more extended periods of steadiness (cruising), along with bursts of acceleration/braking but not the regular high-frequency step-like pattern. The highly rhythmic, repeated peaks in the accelerometer (and the short but frequent gyroscope rotations) are not characteristic of a typical car ride.

1) Overall Signal Variability: The accelerometer signals vary in all three axes with moderate to strong oscillations, which rules out a ‘Still’ activity (where the accelerations would remain nearly constant around the gravity vector).
2) Characteristic Accelerations: The Y‐axis is predominantly around 9–10 m/s² (gravity alignment), but with repeated surges up to about 14–16 m/s². Although these spikes are fairly high, they appear intermittently rather than in very frequent or extremely large bursts (which might be more indicative of running). Such peaks are more consistent with foot impacts during walking.
3) Gyro Magnitude: Gyroscope readings range roughly up to ±1 rad/s. This magnitude of torso rotation is typical of normal steps and turning while walking. Running often shows higher and more frequent angular velocity peaks.
4) Magnetometer: All readings remain negative (orientation with respect to Earth’s field), though they drift. The gradual changes reinforce that the person (and phone) are twisting/turning in a typical gait, rather than remaining still or driving in a car (where orientation changes might be fewer or dominated by different axes).

2) Periodic Surges with Sign Changes: The summary notes “periodic surges” in the Y-axis and noticeable but not extreme X/Z variation. This periodicity is typical of footfalls during running (or brisk locomotion). The presence of sign changes in the Z-axis (sometimes dipping below 0 m/s²) suggests bouts of partial freefall or impact phases, again consistent with running.
3) Moderate Gyroscope Activity: The gyro remains mostly within ±1 rad/s, which reflects moderate torso rotation. Such moderate rotational rates align with running strides, where the torso moves rhythmically but not with the very large angular velocities one might see in more extreme sports.

These are consistent with normal heading/orientation shifts that occur while running rather than a stable orientation (still) or more random/rapid changes (e.g., jumping around or high-speed vehicle turns).

1) Overall Magnitude of Acceleration.
   • The largest acceleration is on the Y-axis (up to ~15.8). This exceeds what we would expect if the subject were merely Still (where the accelerometer would hover around 9.8 m/s² on one axis due to gravity, with small fluctuations). It is also somewhat high, but typically running may push peaks even higher (often well above 15 m/s², depending on the runner and phone placement). These values are, however, comfortably in a range consistent with a brisk or moderate walking pattern.

2) Variability in All Three Axes.
   • The accelerometer X- and Z-axes also show moderate fluctuations (X up to ~9.2, Z from ~−4.8 to +5.6). Stillness would show much smaller variability. Being in a Car often yields more sporadic and less rhythmic peaks aligned with acceleration/braking, whereas this IMU pattern appears more rhythmic and multi-directional, typical of gait.

3) Gyroscope Readings.
   • The gyroscope ranges up to ~±1–1.5 rad/s, with the most swing on the Y-axis. This indicates moderate device rotation (typical of normal arm/torso motion when walking) rather than the larger swings one might see while running (which can produce heavier bobbing/rotation) or the near-constant orientation changes of a bumpy vehicle ride.

4) Magnetometer Behavior.
   • The magnetometer readings remain consistently negative with small changes, indicating the phone’s orientation is fairly stable relative to Earth’s field with mild heading/torso adjustments—again compatible with walking rather than frequent or abrupt orientation shifts.

5) Conclusion.
   • The moderate-to-strong (but not extreme) accelerations, plus modest angular rates, and mild magnetometer shifts are most consistent with a “Walking” activity.

1. Overall Activity Level: The accelerometer data show clear, repeated oscillations with moderate-to-strong peaks. This already rules out “Still” because of the pronounced variations over the entire 10 s.
2. Distinguishing from Running: Running typically exhibits higher frequency steps (more steps per second) and often more pronounced acceleration spikes. Although there are some relatively high peaks (e.g., Y-axis near 16 m/s²), the data overall do not show the very high or sharp impacts characteristic of running strides; they remain in a range consistent with moderately vigorous repeated steps.
3. Distinguishing from Car Travel: In a car, especially on relatively smooth roads, accelerations often have lower-frequency, more erratic changes tied to braking or turning, rather than a cyclical up/down pattern. Here, the accelerometer and gyroscope signatures show a semi-regular oscillatory pattern typical of a person’s torso motion from walking.
4. Repetitive Oscillations and Moderate Angular Velocities: The gyroscope signals confirm rotation about all three axes with moderate amplitude. This again aligns well with steady steps and arm/trunk movements during walking, rather than the large or highly irregular rotations that might appear in more vigorous running or abrupt driving maneuvers.
5. Conclusion: Because the data exhibit a repetitive, moderately active pattern with notable peaks yet no extreme impacts, the action is best classified as “Walking.”

Such pronounced, cyclical peaks are characteristic of a running or jogging pattern rather than light walking or being stationary. Walking can show periodic peaks too but typically not as high.

2) Frequency of Large Accelerations: Within each second (10 samples at 10 Hz), the y-axis has multiple strong spikes (e.g., 12.68, 14.20, 12.51, etc.). This density of larger peaks suggests a faster, higher-impact motion (running strides) rather than the slower stepping of walking.

3) Gyroscope Indications of Moderate Torso Rotation: The gyro data has moderate rotation, especially around the y-axis (sometimes exceeding 1 rad/s), consistent with an active, bouncing torso motion typical of running. However, it is not so extreme as to suggest erratic twisting, so it aligns with a forward-running gait.

These levels are higher than one would expect for gentle or moderate movement (e.g., walking), indicating more forceful impacts consistent with running.

2) Acceleration Pattern:
   • The y-axis has the largest baseline, suggesting that gravity projects primarily onto that axis (the phone likely tilted so that “down” aligns with y). However, the rapid changes (and spikes up to ~16 m/s²) go beyond just a steady tilt and point to dynamic, repetitive impacts typical of running strides.
   • The z-axis crosses from negative to positive with large swings (−7 m/s² to +9.6 m/s²), indicating the phone is experiencing pronounced vertical bounces or tilts—again consistent with higher-impact motion (running) rather than mere walking.

3) Gyroscope Readings:
   • The gyro data show bursts of rotation in the x and y axes up to around ±1.3 rad/s. Such moderate-to-high angular velocities also fit with the torso rotating more vigorously when running vs. the smoother, slower sway of walking. While driving in a car could induce turns, the phone would typically not see such sharp, repeated torso-level angular velocities.

4) Magnetometer Variation:
   • The magnetometer axes cross negative/positive ranges, indicating the phone changes orientation relative to the Earth’s magnetic field. While this alone does not distinguish walking from running, the overall orientation shifts align with more active body movements.

2. Rapid Variation in Multiple Axes: The x-axis and y-axis accelerations both exhibit significant positive and negative excursions and large spikes. Still or car movements typically produce lower-frequency, more stable signals. The large, frequent spikes indicate forceful impacts (typical of running strides).
3. Gyro Bursts: The gyroscope readings also show multiple episodes of significant rotation (> 2 rad/s in x-, y-axes). This is consistent with the repetitive bounding motion of running, where a runner’s torso undergoes larger and more rapid tilts than during walking.
4. Not Consistent with Still or Car: A still person would have much lower and more constant acceleration and rotation. Car motion usually does not elevate vertical acceleration to 4+ g levels (i.e., ~40 m/s^2). Cars tend to have relatively smoother, more gradual changes unless in off-road conditions; even then, 43 m/s^2 would be unusually high.

Walking usually produces distinctly smaller acceleration amplitudes (often below ~2–3g), and being still or in a car would not approach these vertical spikes.

2. Axis-Specific Observations:
   • Acceleration in Y-axis: The torso sees substantial vertical/transient impacts, which is consistent with the bouncing or impact motions during running strides. 
   • Acceleration in X-axis: Reaches up to +18.5 m/s², indicating additional forward/lateral acceleration bursts.
   • Acceleration in Z-axis: Ranges from about −11.7 to +8 m/s², showing additional directional changes but not as extreme as y.

3. Gyroscope Data: Moderate-to-strong rotations on x and y axes (e.g., up to ±3.8 rad/s) align with the forward-backward pitching of the torso and some rolling while running. This rotational pattern is greater than would be expected for a casual walk or a relatively smooth car ride.

4. Magnetometer Readings: While the magnetometer primarily shows a strong negative offset on y (typical of a phone orientation relative to Earth’s field), the additional x–z variability suggests the phone was indeed changing its heading/orientation, again consistent with an active motion like running.

   – The gyroscope shows moderate-to-high rotation rates (some readings exceed ±2 rad/s on x and y axes). This points to frequent turning or torso twisting.
   – Such turning/twisting is commonplace in walking with changes in direction, especially if the user is looking around or pivoting.
   – Although running can also show elevated rotational rates, extremely high or very rhythmic rotation might be more expected for a sprint. Here, the rotations are pronounced but fall into a range often associated with an active walk with turns.

3) Magnetometer Consistency
   – The magnetometer’s y-axis lies mostly in a tight negative band (near −48 to −50), suggesting that axis is roughly aligned with Earth’s magnetic field. The x and z magnetometer readings vary across positive and negative values, indicating the phone is being rotated in 3D space.
   – These fluctuations align with walking while changing orientation, rather than sitting (still) or traveling by vehicle (car), where orientation changes tend to be less abrupt or predominantly in one plane.

4) Distinguishing Between Still, Walking, Run, and Car
   – Still: Ruled out by the large, frequent accelerations and rotations.
   – Car: Typically exhibits steadier readings or smaller changes unless on a very rough road or accelerating/decelerating vigorously. The data here show frequent torso-level movements/spikes inconsistent with a typical car ride.
   – Run: While the data do indicate vigorous motion, there is not a sustained high-intensity pattern one might see in a run (with consistently high impacts each step). Instead, we see bursts that fit brisk or active walking with turns.
   – Walking: Matches best overall, with moderate-to-vigorous movements, turning, and occasional impact spikes.

Putting these observations together, the patterns are most consistent with a period of walking that involves turns or transitions in posture, rather than running, stillness, or riding in a car.",False

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude: The accelerometer channels show very large swings—particularly in the y-axis, which has values up to about 36 m/s² (around 3.7 g if 1 g ≈ 9.8 m/s²). Such high‐amplitude peaks are more characteristic of running than walking, driving, or being still.

2) Repeated Peaks and Dips: The acceleration data contain multiple short bursts of large positive and negative values across x, y, and z. This pattern, over a 10-second window, suggests a rapid, cyclical motion consistent with strides/impacts during running.

3) Gyroscope Activity: While not extremely large, the moderate rotational rates (up to ±3+ in the y-axis, and around ±2 in x) still indicate consistent torso rotation or sway. Running often involves more upper-body rotation than walking, aligning with these gyroscope readings.

4) Elimination of Other Classes:
   • Still: The wide accelerometer and gyroscope ranges rule out being stationary.
   • Car: Although in-vehicle motion can sometimes show spikes (e.g., potholes or braking), here the acceleration is more frequently and rhythmically peaking, typical of footstep impacts rather than intermittent car movements.
   • Walking: Walking tends to show lower overall acceleration magnitudes (commonly between 10–20 m/s² peaks). The very high peaks around the mid-30s more plausibly match running, especially for a torso-mounted phone.

Because of the high-amplitude, repeated (likely footstep-related) impacts in the accelerometer data and moderate yet consistent torso rotations in the gyroscope data, the best fit is that the person was running.",True

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude: The accelerometer’s y‑axis (often sensitive to vertical/up‑down motion at the torso) exhibits very large values—peaking around 41 m/s² (about 4 g). While normal walking can produce accelerations in the 1–2 g range at the torso, 4 g peaks are more consistent with running.
2) Periodic Spikes: The repeated high positive and negative swings in the x– and z–axes (in addition to the very large y–axis spikes) indicate a strong impact or footstrike pattern typical of running stride rather than relaxed walking. Walking usually has more moderate amplitudes.
3) Gyroscope Activity: The gyroscope x– and y–axes reach around ±2–3, showing pronounced pitch/roll consistent with running form (the torso moves more vigorously than during walking or sitting in a car).
4) Excluding “Still”: The large, frequent accelerations and angular velocities rule out a still/immobile activity.
5) Excluding “Car”: Although car rides can have bumps, consistently reaching 4 g acceleration spikes on the torso IMU is less common; the pattern of strong, repeated footstep-like impacts is more like running than typical vehicle motion.
6) Conclusion: The combination of high, repeated acceleration spikes (especially on the vertical axis), notable changes in orientation, and large angular velocities strongly suggests the user was running, as opposed to walking or being in a car.",True
1566,1498149248160.0,1498149258150.0,Run,Run,"1) First, I examined the accelerometer data: it shows very large swings on all axes, with the y-axis reaching up to about 40 m/s². This is roughly equivalent to 4 times standard gravity (g ≈ 9.8 m/s²) and is far higher than the typical accelerations fluctuating around ±10–15 m/s² seen in normal walking. Such high bursts strongly suggest a high-intensity activity such as running.

2) Next, I looked at the gyroscope data: it exhibits moderate to somewhat large rotational rates (up to ±2–3 rad/s). This indicates that the phone’s orientation is changing often and relatively quickly—consistent with the torso movement one would expect from running (as opposed to more subdued rotations if just walking or sitting still).

3) Finally, the magnetometer readings show variable x/z axes but a fairly stable negative y-axis. While this helps confirm overall device motion/rotation in Earth’s magnetic field, it is the accelerometer and gyroscope magnitudes and frequencies that primarily distinguish energetic activities like running from lighter movement (e.g., walking) or relatively steady conditions (e.g., sitting still or riding in a car at constant speed).

Putting all sensor observations together, the repeated large accelerations coupled with moderate to high rotational rates are characteristic of running, rather than the gentler periodic pattern expected in walking or the relatively smoother signals from sitting still or being in a car.",True

1) Look at the overall acceleration magnitudes: The accelerometer Y-axis bursts regularly climb into the 40+ m/s² range, far above typical walking accelerations. These repeated high spikes (well over 4 g) are more indicative of running or very vigorous movement.
2) Check frequency/pattern of bursts: The data exhibit recurring peak–valley cycles on the accelerometer (especially Y-axis) and corresponding moderate-to-strong gyroscopic activity about X and Y. This pattern aligns with the body’s cyclical up-down/forward-backward motion during a run.
3) Compare with other activities:
   • ‘Still’ would show very low, relatively flat signals, which we clearly do not see.
   • ‘Walking’ would have a similar cyclical pattern but typically lower peak accelerations. Seeing spikes as high as ~45 m/s² is unusually high for normal walking.
   • ‘Car’ could show some bursts under aggressive maneuvers or bumpy roads, but repeated spikes at 4–5 g are not typical in standard driving conditions, nor would they be so cyclically repeated over the entire 10 s.

1. Overall Motion Intensity:
   • The accelerometer readings show very large peaks (notably up to +43 m/s² on the y-axis). Such high-amplitude spikes on a smartphone placed on the torso are much more consistent with running or other high-impact activity than with walking, standing still, or riding in a car.

2. Acceleration Characteristics:
   • For calm, low-intensity activities (like Still or Car), typical torso accelerations are notably lower—often under ±5–10 m/s² with few abrupt high spikes. Walking might show moderate spikes (often below about 15–20 m/s²). However, the presence of values in the 30–40+ m/s² range suggests intensive foot or body impacts, which aligns with running.
   • The accelerometer data show repeated fluctuation patterns and large bursts, indicating repeated impacts consistent with a running gait.

3. Gyroscope Readings:
   • The angular rates (up to ±3–4 rad/s in x and y) also point to vigorous motion, as the torso and phone are being rotated more abruptly than in gentle walking or sitting in a vehicle.
   • Mild or moderate activities (like Still or Car) usually have smaller, smoother gyroscope readings.

4. Magnetometer Observations:
   • The near-constant magnetometer y-axis (about −45 to −49 µT) predominantly indicates the device heading/orientation. The larger variability on x and z axes is explained by the phone’s movement, but these changes alone do not conclusively distinguish running vs. walking.
   • The decisive information is primarily from the accelerometer’s large spikes, which strongly indicate a vigorous, repetitive motion.

5. Conclusion:
   • High-amplitude accelerations with repeated impacts, combined with moderate-to-high gyroscopic activity, are most closely associated with “Run.”
   • Therefore, based on the magnitude and pattern of the IMU signals, the user was running.",True

1) Overall magnitude of accelerations: The accelerometer data shows repeated, intense peaks—particularly on the y-axis, which reaches values in the 40+ m/s² range (≈4 g). These spikes are quite high for typical walking, suggesting a more vigorous activity (running often yields significantly larger accelerations compared to walking).

2) Variability and bursts of motion in accelerometer signals: The x- and y-axes both exhibit substantial swings (+17 m/s² on x and +45 m/s² on y at peaks), indicating strong impacts or footfalls. Such large and frequent changes in acceleration are consistent with running.

3) Gyroscope patterns: The gyroscope shows moderate-to-high rotation rates (e.g., y-axis dips around −3.4 rad/s and rises above +2 rad/s) interspersed with periods of rotation near zero. Rapid changes in axis rotation align with the bouncy, repetitive nature of running strides (though running form can cause variable torso rotation).

4) Exclusion of “Car” and “Still”: The accelerometer signals have much higher and more frequent peaks than typically seen during relatively smooth car travel or a stationary scenario. Even on rough roads, it is less common to sustain repeated spikes over 3–4 g in short bursts. Being “still” is clearly ruled out by these large dynamic ranges.

5) Comparison with “Walking”: Walking often presents a lower peak acceleration profile (commonly in the 1–2 g range), whereas running frequently surpasses that by producing sharper, larger peaks. The large y-axis swings up to 40+ m/s² are more in line with running.

Given these observations—the significant accelerations, bursts in gyroscope data, and the characteristic intensity of torso movement—the most plausible classification is that the user is running.",True

1) Overall magnitude of acceleration: The accelerometer readings show frequent peaks well above ±15 m/s², with the Y-axis even reaching about +25 m/s² and the Z-axis dipping to −20 m/s². Both the range and number of these large spikes are much higher than would typically be seen in slow, steady activities such as walking or being still, and they also exceed what would usually happen from gentle shifts in a car.

2) High variability in all axes: The torso-mounted phone experiences strong movement in X, Y, and Z. This breadth of large positive/negative swings suggests the body is undergoing repeated impact or bouncing consistent with the stride impacts of running (as opposed to the more moderate oscillations associated with walking or the lower-frequency accelerations in a car).

3) Gyroscope evidence of frequent orientation changes: The gyroscope data show moderate-to-high angular velocities in multiple axes, especially large negative dips around −4.7 rad/s on the Y-axis. This level of rotational activity aligns with a running gait’s torso rotation and arm swing, rather than the more subdued rotations of walking or sitting still.

4) Magnetometer context: Although magnetometer readings are strongly negative in the Y-axis (reflecting the dominant local magnetic field component), X and Z vary significantly. This is consistent with the phone frequently changing heading and tilt, which again supports a dynamic motion such as running.

Putting these factors together—large-amplitude accelerations, extensive rotational changes, and broad variation in magnetometer orientations—the most plausible conclusion is that the person was running.",True

1) Overall Magnitude of Accelerations:
   • The accelerometer ranges are quite large, especially on the Y-axis (up to around 26 m/s²). That is well above what is typically seen in light activities such as standing still or gentle walking, and it suggests high-impact foot strikes or abrupt movements consistent with running.
   • The X-axis also shows strong spikes up to roughly 17–18 m/s², again indicating forceful motions in the phone’s horizontal plane.

2) Gyroscope Activity:
   • The gyroscope signals exhibit notable bursts around ±2 rad/s on the X and Y axes. This indicates moderate-to-strong angular velocity—phones on the torso often pick up significant rotation from the user’s upper body motion when running.
   • While walking can also display cyclical gyro patterns, the magnitude here leans more toward running or similarly vigorous activity.

3) Comparison to Other Classes:
   • Still: The data clearly show large variations and spikes, ruling out a “Still” activity.
   • Walking: Typically has lower peak accelerations (often up to around 10–15 m/s² on a torso-mounted phone). Although walking can have repeated steps, the very high 20+ m/s² bursts point to a more intense action.
   • Car: While driving can generate spikes (e.g., from bumps or turns), we generally would not see such a strong repetitive impact pattern and large amplitude changes in quick succession; the torso would also not likely experience such pronounced cyclical impact forces.

4) Conclusion:
   • The strong, repeated acceleration peaks (especially approaching or exceeding 2–3 g) and the moderate-to-high angular velocities around two axes are typical of running (or vigorous jogging). Therefore, “Run” is the most consistent label with the observed IMU trends.",True

Such strong, rhythmic impacts are more characteristic of running than walking or standing still. Walking typically has lower peak accelerations (often under ~15 m/s²), while sitting still or driving in a car would not produce such regularly spaced, large spikes over a full 10 s window.
2) Z-Axis Orientation and Occasional Positive Spikes: The z-axis values frequently hover in negative territory (aligned with gravity), but there are abrupt positive surges. This indicates the user’s torso is oriented so that gravity is primarily in the negative z direction, with transient upward/forward motions that coincide with running strides.
3) Gyroscope Activity: Moderate to strong rotations about the x and y axes support the idea of ongoing, active torso motions (pitch and roll), which matches with running strides and the associated arm/torso swings. If the user were still, there would be minimal rotation. Driving in a car tends to have more stable orientations with occasional turns, but generally not this strong, rhythmic pitch/roll pattern.
4) Magnetometer Stability: The magnetic readings vary slowly, indicating incremental changes in heading consistent with normal body movements. They do not show drastic shifts that might occur from frequent or erratic orientation changes (e.g., a phone loosely moving around in a vehicle). The stable yet slightly shifting pattern is consistent with a running torso movement.

Such high and repeated peaks/dips are more consistent with running (which generates greater torso impact) than with walking, standing still, or riding in a car.
2. Periodic bursts in acceleration: The data exhibit a repeating pattern of short bursts, especially noticeable on the Y-axis. Walking can produce smaller, more regular peaks, but the amplitude here is quite high, indicating a more vigorous motion typical of running.
3. Gyroscope activity: The gyroscope data, especially along the Y-axis (ranging roughly from −6.5 to +4.3), also show repeated changes and moderate-to-strong rotation, consistent with the torso twists/bounces that occur when running.

   – The accelerometer readings show repeated spikes well above the 9.8 m/s² gravity level, including values frequently in the range 15–20+ m/s² (up to about 24 m/s² on the y-axis). Such high dynamic excursions are more characteristic of running (where short bursts of 2 g or more may occur when the torso bounces), rather than walking (which typically has smaller peaks) or traveling in a car (unlikely to produce repeated ±2+ g spikes).

2) Variations per Axis:
   – All three axes exhibit significant positive and negative excursions, suggesting vigorous body motion and frequent changes in device orientation. In walking data, you do see oscillations around gravity, but the amplitude and frequency of these large spikes here suggest a more intense activity (i.e., running).

3) Gyroscope Behavior:
   – The gyroscope data show moderate swings (roughly ±2–3 deg/s) in multiple axes. Although these are not extremely large, they still indicate frequent rotations consistent with running gait (torso twists and turns), instead of the more subdued rotation you might see while walking or sitting still.

4) Magnetometer Stability:
   – As usual, the magnetometer is comparatively stable and reflects primarily the device orientation with respect to Earth’s magnetic field. It does not strongly differentiate among walking, running, or car travel, so the deciding factor comes from the accelerometer and gyroscope.

5) Conclusion:
   – The combination of high-magnitude and repetitive burst-like accelerations, along with moderate rotational data, is most consistent with running rather than walking (lower accelerations), being still (minimal changes), or riding in a car (different acceleration profile with fewer repeated torsional movements).",True

1. Overall Motion Intensity: The accelerometer data show very large spikes (notably up to ~36 m/s² on the Y-axis). Those values are higher than one would typically see during casual walking or gentle movement, suggesting a more vigorous activity.

2. Amplitude of Acceleration: Walking often has peaks substantially below 20 m/s² when measured on the torso, whereas peaks above 30 m/s² suggest stronger impacts consistent with running strides. The X- and Y-axis accelerations both reveal sharp bursts, again indicative of a high-impact, repeated motion pattern.

3. Gyroscope Variations: The gyroscope readings display recurring positive/negative swings—most pronounced on the Y-axis—implying a dynamic rotation of the torso in sync with an active gait. This rotational pattern further aligns with running (which causes more rotational sway in the torso than walking).

4. Magnetometer Behavior: The magnetometer readings are relatively slow-moving; this is typical of changes in orientation rather than large bumps or vibrations. The smoother changes in magnetic field direction fit with a body movement pattern (heading/orientation shifts) rather than a mostly stationary orientation that would be seen in a car or a still position.

   - The recorded linear accelerations reach very large peaks, for example +23 m/s² on the x-axis and around +38–39 m/s² on the y-axis. These values far exceed typical walking accelerations (which more commonly peak in the ±10–15 m/s² range when torso-mounted). Repeated spikes approaching or exceeding 3–4 g (≈30–40 m/s²) are more indicative of running or vigorous bounding motions than of casual walking.

2) Fluctuation Pattern in Accelerations:  
   - The data do not hover near one dominant level (as would be the case if the user were mostly still or sitting in a car at a constant speed). Instead, the accelerations show frequent sign changes and high-amplitude bursts, which aligns with the footfall impacts and torso oscillations typically seen in running.

3) Gyroscope Activity:  
   - The gyroscope data also show moderate-to-high variability (e.g., y-axis from about −4.9 to +3.2), reflecting repeated and substantial angular motions (pitch/roll) of the torso, consistent with running strides. Although walking has some cyclical rotations, the combination of large accelerations and relatively wide gyroscope excursions strongly suggests running.

4) Magnetometer Trends:  
   - The magnetometer channels remain in roughly the same polarity (negative x, negative y, positive z) with moderate shifts, which indicates the phone is not flipping orientation entirely but is tilting enough to produce swings within those axes. This is consistent with the phone being firmly attached to a bouncing torso, as opposed to a more stable orientation in a car.

5) Comparison With Other Classes:  
   - Still: The data are far too dynamic (large spikes, frequent sign changes) for a stationary activity.
   - Walking: Though walking can produce periodic spikes, seeing multiple surges in the 20–40 m/s² range is uncommonly high for walking.
   - Car: Driving often produces some bumps and occasional peaks, but repeated 3–4 g spikes are uncommon unless in extremely rough conditions (and even then, the pattern would typically differ from the regular stride-related bursts).

1) The accelerometer signals are very large and highly variable, especially in the y-axis (with peaks near +29 m/s²) and substantial swings on x and z. Such high-magnitude repeated peaks suggest strong torso impacts or bouncing typical of running or jumping, rather than the more moderate, regular pattern of walking or the relatively low variation of still/car.
2) The gyroscope data exhibit moderate (but not extreme) angular velocities, with repeated oscillations in both positive and negative directions. This is consistent with the torso tilting and twisting that often accompanies a running gait.
3) The magnetometer data show gradual heading changes rather than abrupt or extreme shifts, indicating the user’s orientation is changing but not spinning rapidly (again consistent with body orientation adjustments during running rather than, for example, rotating in a vehicle).
4) Taken together, the strong repeated accelerations (especially along the vertical axis), moderate angular velocities, and mild but continuous orientation changes most closely match a running activity pattern. A still or walking activity would have significantly less intense acceleration peaks, and car travel typically has a different pattern of more uniform or less rhythmic accelerations.

2. Range of Accelerations: Typical walking accelerations for a torso-mounted device can reach around ±10 to ±15 m/s², but repeated accelerations above 30 m/s² (as observed here) point toward more forceful impacts and higher-intensity steps consistent with running.

3. Gyroscope Spikes: The gyroscope readings exhibit multiple peaks around ±3 – 4 rad/s on the x and y axes. This indicates significant rotational motion (torso twisting/bobbing) that usually accompanies faster footfalls and energetic movement, aligning with running rather than a casual walk or riding in a car.

4. Magnetometer Stability: Although the magnetometer values vary with orientation changes, they do not show large magnetic disturbances. This is more a sign of body/phone reorientation than a rapid change in external magnetic fields (such as might happen very close to strong ferromagnetic materials in a vehicle). The relatively narrow magnetometer ranges mainly confirm the phone is moving and tilting but does not suggest an environment strongly influenced by automotive metal or electronics.

   • The y-axis in particular shows very large peaks (above +30 m/s², sometimes exceeding +40 m/s²), which is much higher than typical walking or gentle driving vibrations. Such strong impacts are more characteristic of running strides where each foot impact can produce large transient accelerations.
   • The x- and z-axes also show pronounced positive and negative swings, indicating active torso movement and reorientation relative to gravity. Still or walking activities usually exhibit lower ranges of acceleration.

2) Gyroscope Activity:
   • All three gyroscope axes show repeated bursts of rotation (with notable positive and negative swings). This aligns with vigorous arm/torso swinging or twisting that commonly occurs during running, rather than the gentler, more periodic rotations of walking or the relatively stable orientation one would see when still or seated in a car.
   • The presence of rapid changes in rotation further supports high-intensity motion.

3) Magnetometer Stability:
   • Despite dynamic motion, the magnetometer readings remain consistently negative on x and y, and positive on z, suggesting the phone remained in a similar magnetic heading quadrant—but with moderate tilts. This fits with a user who is running in relatively the same heading, rather than turning dramatically (as might be seen with a vehicle making large turns) or standing still.

   • Still: Would not produce large spikes in linear acceleration or strong gyroscopic bursts.
   • Walking: Tends to have lower peak accelerations (generally <20 m/s²) and smoother, less intense rotations.

2. Repeated cycles of positive and negative accelerations on multiple axes (particularly X and Z, but also large changes in Y) suggest a forceful, rhythmic torso motion typical of running strides. Walking generally shows lower peak accelerations (often <20 m/s²), whereas running can reach 30 m/s² or more.

Walking typically shows lower peak accelerations, whereas running can produce large, repeated impact forces on the torso. The fact that such large spikes occur repeatedly suggests a high-impact, rhythmic activity more consistent with running than with walking or being in a car.
   • The x- and z-axis also exhibit significant fluctuations (up to ~16–17 m/s² in x and ~22–23 m/s² in z), supporting the idea of a vigorous, repetitive motion.

2. Gyroscope data:
   • Moderate to high rotational activity around x and y axes, with intermittent spikes, aligns with torso twisting or pitching that often accompanies running (as opposed to relatively gentler tilts in normal walking or relatively steady orientation when seated still).
   • While a car could show some rotational changes (around turns), it usually would not produce this repeated, rhythmic rotational pattern typical of steps.

3. Magnetometer observations:
   • The magnetometer readings remain in relatively narrow ranges, with mostly modest shifts. This is expected for normal orientation changes that happen with body motion; it does not particularly distinguish running from other dynamic activities, but it shows no evidence of multiple abrupt changes one might expect with sudden, strong external influence (e.g., erratic car motion on rough roads).

4. Excluding other categories:
   • 'Still' would show much lower overall accelerations and minimal gyroscope activity. This dataset has large, repeated accelerations.
   • 'Walking' typically has lower acceleration magnitudes and a more moderate pattern of peaks. The very high spikes suggest impact forces stronger than typical walking.
   • 'Car' might yield accelerometer changes from acceleration/braking and turns, but usually not in a strongly repetitive or rhythmic pattern that matches footsteps (especially with the recorded large, sinusoid-like pulses on the y-axis).

Based on these considerations, the large, rhythmic spikes on the y-axis and the overall combination of acceleration and rotation activity strongly suggest a running motion.",True

1. Overall Motion Magnitude: The accelerometer shows large swings (up to ≈36 m/s² on the Y-axis and ≈26 m/s² on the Z-axis), which are quite high magnitudes. These are larger than would typically be seen in gentle walking or light daily activities.

2. Cyclical/Repeated Patterns: The accelerometer signals do not stay near a steady offset but exhibit repeated peaks and troughs. This pattern usually corresponds to the cyclic nature of steps or bursts of movement rather than the more sustained or smoother accelerations one might see in vehicular travel.

3. Rapid Rotations: The gyroscope data shows frequent sign changes and moderate-to-high peaks on all axes (X, Y, and Z), suggesting that the torso (and thus the phone) is rotating briskly. Running especially involves more vigorous multi-axis body rotations compared to walking.

4. Comparison with Other Activities:
   • Still/Stationary: Would show small accelerations closer to gravity with minimal variation. Clearly not the case here.
   • Walking: Typically shows more moderate amplitude accelerations and somewhat rhythmic patterns, but not usually up to ≈36 m/s² spikes.
   • Car Travel: Often exhibits accelerations oriented in one plane (e.g., forward/back or lateral for turning), not such strong cyclical vertical/lateral/forward-back swings in the same 10 s window.

5. Conclusion: The large amplitude, cyclical/step-like patterns, and multi-axis rotation strongly suggest running rather than walking or other modes of transportation.",True

1. Activity Candidates: The possible labels are Still, Walking, Run, or Car.
2. Overall Motion Level: The accelerometer data exhibit large, periodic fluctuations on all axes, with peaks going up to around 28 m/s² (notably on the y-axis). Such high-magnitude, repeated patterns suggest energetic, cyclic torso movements—unlikely if the person were simply Still or sitting in a Car (which typically has less rhythmic acceleration unless over extremely bumpy terrain).
3. Comparison to Walking vs. Running: Walking usually shows lower peak accelerations (commonly in the range of ~10–20 m/s² spikes when measured on the torso). In contrast, running often yields stronger peak magnitudes (in this case, reaching ~28 m/s²) and more rapid cyclic fluctuations.
4. Gyroscope Indicators: Moderate angular rates about the x- and y-axes also fit with the vigorous upper-body pitch and roll motions often seen in running. Although walking involves periodic rotations too, the higher accelerations combined with multiple short bursts of angular velocity align more with running.
5. Conclusion: Taken together—the larger and more frequent acceleration peaks, moderate to higher angular rate swings, and clear cyclic pattern—point most strongly to a Run rather than a Walk, Still, or Car scenario.",True

2) The gyroscope data also exhibits significant swings (−3.8 to +3.6 on the y‑axis and around −2.6 to +1.5 on the x‑axis), indicating substantial rotational movement consistent with vigorous torso motion during running.
3) The magnetometer, while relatively stable compared to the accelerometer/gyroscope signals, still shows some variation indicative of changes in device orientation, which also fits with the larger upper‐body motions of running.

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitude and Spikes:
   • The accelerometer data shows very large spikes, especially on the y-axis (up to around +31 m/s²). This amplitude corresponds to multiple g-forces (1 g ≈ 9.8 m/s²), which is indicative of forceful, repeated impacts rather than the lighter oscillations typical of walking.
   • The repeated positive/negative swings across the axes (x, y, z) suggest a rhythmic pattern of foot strikes and body motion, consistent with running.

2) High Rotational (Gyroscope) Activity:
   • The gyroscope shows strong peaks around the x- and y-axes. Running often involves pronounced torso tilts and twists as the runner strides and balances. While walking has some torso rotation, the degree of rapid rotation seen here is more characteristic of running.
   • If this had been sitting in a car, the rotations would more likely be smooth or momentary (e.g., during a turn), rather than strongly repeating over the entire 10-second window.

3) Magnetometer Consistency:
   • The magnetometer signals remain negative on x/y and positive on z, indicating the phone’s orientation relative to magnetic north. Although there are fluctuations, these appear to be minor orientation changes from torso movement, not large directional changes like frequent or rapid turns in a car.
   • The magnetometer data primarily supports that the phone orientation is relatively stable (in 3D space) except for moderate tilts and twists that accompany running steps.

4) Final Judgment of Activity:
   • “Still” and “Walking” are unlikely given large and frequent acceleration spikes.
   • The data does not resemble the typical pattern of being in a car, where most changes in acceleration or rotation occur with braking, acceleration, or turning events; instead, we see a continuous, rhythmic high-impact pattern.
   • Combining the strong, repeated accelerations (up to ~3 g in y) and substantial torso rotation strongly supports that the user is running.

1) Acceleration Magnitudes: The accelerometer exhibits very large swings, with the y-axis peaking at around 30+ m/s² (about 3 g) and z-axis spanning from roughly −17 or −18 m/s² to +20 m/s². Such high amplitudes are more common in vigorous, repetitive activities like running than in walking or sitting still.

2) Repetitive Peaks/Valleys: The acceleration data has multiple strong peaks and valleys. This pattern is consistent with footstrikes (landing and push-off phases) that occur in running, causing larger shocks that propagate through the torso.

3) Gyroscope Behavior: The gyroscope signals (rotational rates) show noticeable bursts but remain within a few degrees per second. This indicates movement involving torso rotation, but the key point is still the large translational accelerations that suggest more than a gentle walk.

4) Magnetometer Stability: The magnetometer data remains in a relatively narrow band of negative x, negative y, and positive z. That tells us the phone orientation relative to Earth’s magnetic field is fairly consistent—this is typical of many upright activities and does not by itself confirm running. However, it confirms that the phone orientation is not changing drastically.

5) Activity Differentiation: • “Still” would have very little fluctuation in acceleration. • “Walking” could have moderate cyclical accelerations up to around 2 g, but large spikes above 3 g are less typical. • “Car” data can show variability but usually not the strong, regular, high-amplitude steps characteristic of running. • “Run” commonly exhibits these periodic, high-intensity acceleration peaks. Hence, given the combination of large amplitude accelerations and moderate angular velocities, running is the most likely.

Taken together, the high-amplitude, cyclical acceleration profile strongly indicates the user was running.",True

1. Acceleration Magnitudes: The y-axis acceleration peaks exceed 30 m/s² (~3 g) and the x- and z-axes similarly have large excursions (up to ~17–18 m/s²). Such high, repeated spikes are more characteristic of running than walking (which tends to exhibit lower peak accelerations) or riding in a car (which usually produces smoother or infrequent acceleration bursts). The overall acceleration pattern is vigorous and periodic.

2. Gyroscope Activity: The gyroscope signals show non-trivial angular velocities on multiple axes, indicating continuous torso rotation or tilting. While walking does produce some rotation, the combined large linear and angular changes seen here typically correspond to more energetic motions such as running.

3. Elimination of Other Classes:
   • Still: Clearly ruled out by the large, frequent spikes in acceleration and rotation.
   • Car: Although riding in a car can include bursts of acceleration (e.g., braking or turning), the highly repetitive and large-magnitude spikes align better with a running gait cycle than with typical automotive motion.
   • Walking: Walking typically has noticeable but smaller amplitude acceleration peaks than those measured. Peaks above 3 g strongly suggest running.

1) Overall accelerometer stability: The accelerometer readings for x (~4.7–4.8 m/s²), y (~8.0 m/s²), and z (~3.0 m/s²) remain near quasi‑constant baselines with only small oscillations. This collectively sums to a vector magnitude close to Earth’s gravity (~9.8 m/s²). If the user were walking or running, one would typically observe more pronounced rhythmic fluctuations in the acceleration data.

2) Low gyroscope activity punctuated by a small spike: The gyroscope data remain near zero overall with a single brief rotation or twist event. In walking or running, one would generally see more repeated angular motion spikes (due to steps). In driving a car, there could be turns or changes in orientation that might produce somewhat larger or more frequent gyroscopic changes if the torso/phone moved in corners or due to acceleration/deceleration.

3) Magnetometer readings relatively stable: All magnetometer axes remain in a negative range with modest fluctuations and no major directional shifts. This is consistent with a stable orientation relative to the ambient magnetic field, without substantial or continuous re-orientations.

4) Conclusion: The near-stationary nature of the accelerometer and gyroscope, along with the lack of any strong dynamic signatures (e.g., step cycles, running impacts, or car-driven accelerations) and the small single rotation event, together suggest that the user is predominantly motionless or “Still” over the 10-second interval.",False

1. Overall accelerometer ranges and behavior: The reported X/Y/Z accelerations remain fairly steady (e.g., X ~ 4.58–5.06, Y ~ 7.59–8.25, Z ~ 2.39–3.34 m/s²) with only modest undulations—no large periodic swings or impacts typical of walking or running, nor the broader or less predictable accelerations one might see in a car (accelerations, braking, turning, etc.).

2. Gyroscope activity: The gyroscope readings hover very close to zero most of the time, with only small, brief excursions (e.g., ±0.15 rad/s on X, ±0.28 on Y, ±0.08 on Z). Such low angular velocities indicate minimal sustained rotation. Continuous walking or running usually introduces more pronounced, periodic rotations about torso axes, while car rides often include stronger rotational changes from turns.

3. Magnetometer signals: These show gradual drifts (−4.56 to −2.57 on X, −20.5 to −18.2 on Y, −9.62 to −7.38 on Z) rather than sudden spikes. While this helps confirm that the phone’s orientation changed slightly, it does not suggest a more active scenario such as vigorous walking or running, nor abrupt heading changes as might be seen in a vehicle making turns.

4. Conclusion: The mild torso motion, small rotation spikes, and otherwise stable readings are most consistent with the user being essentially still or very lightly shifting posture rather than engaging in walking, running, or car travel. Therefore, the best fit is “Still.”

1. Overall Magnitude and Variation of Accelerometer Signals:
   • The accelerometer data shows moderate variability in x (≈3.48 to 5.96 m/s²) and a steady “base” near 8 m/s² on y (which mostly captures gravity), with z occasionally swinging from negative (~−2.4) to positive (~4.0). This range of acceleration is characteristic of a person in motion but not at the high intensities typically seen in running (where peak accelerations can reach well above 2 g on the torso). The spread suggests periodic torso movement consistent with walking.

2. Gyroscope Magnitudes and Spikes:
   • The gyroscope has moderate (not extreme) angular rates, with the most pronounced spikes around ±0.5 to 1.0 rad/s on some axes. While these indicate body/phone rotations, they are not so large as to suggest the vigorous twisting often seen in running. The presence of repeated modest rotational bursts aligns with the torso swings that occur during walking steps.

3. Contrast with Other Activities:
   • Still: The data clearly show too much variation (in both accelerometer and gyroscope) for the user to be standing or sitting completely still.
   • Running: Running often produces larger and more frequent peaks (both in linear acceleration and rotational rates) due to stronger foot impacts and more vigorous torso movement.
   • Car: Driving in a car can show spikier or smoother patterns governed by road conditions and vehicle motion (e.g., acceleration/braking/turns). The repeated oscillatory nature here and relatively moderate amplitude are more typical of a person’s gait.

1) Examine overall acceleration magnitudes and variation:
   • The accelerometer values hover around a total magnitude consistent with gravity (~9–10 m/s² when split across x, y, z). However, they exhibit small-to-moderate spikes (e.g., y-axis spikes up to ~9.6 and dips down to ~5.3). Such moderate but definite fluctuations are characteristic of step-like torso movements, rather than the very low variation of standing still or the larger, more forceful variations typical of running.

2) Inspect rotation from gyroscope data:
   • The gyroscope ranges are quite small in all axes (roughly -0.27 to 0.42). This implies no large twisting or turning motions. Walking often involves a mild sway in torso rotation, which is consistent with these subtle changes, whereas running would typically produce more pronounced angular velocity peaks, and being still would exhibit even less variability.

3) Consider magnetometer stability:
   • The magnetometer signals are fairly steady and do not show abrupt directional changes. This suggests the phone orientation and heading remained reasonably constant, compatible with a person walking in a straight or gently varying path. If the user were running at higher speed or riding in a car with turns and accelerations, one could expect more distinctive changes in heading or abrupt variations.

4) Differentiating walking from still, run, or car:
   • Still: Would show a narrower, near-constant acceleration close to gravity with minimal fluctuations. Here, we see moderate but noticeable oscillations.
   • Run: Tends to have larger, more forceful acceleration spikes and somewhat higher gyroscope fluctuations. The moderate amplitude here is more in line with walking.
   • Car: Often has a combination of fairly smooth or vibration-prone accelerations plus possible sharper changes when turning or braking. The steady yet periodic nature in this dataset aligns more closely with footstep-induced torso movement.

   – When considering all three acceleration components together, the resulting magnitude is near the gravitational norm (~9.8 m/s²), suggesting the phone is mostly stationary with gravity distributed across the axes (due to its orientation/bias).

   – Gyroscope readings stay close to zero across all three axes (ranges around -0.1 to +0.2 rad/s), pointing to minimal rotation of the torso. Occasional small fluctuations suggest only minor posture shifts or slight movements.
   – Such low rotational activity is more consistent with being still than with active gait (walking or running), which typically introduces a larger periodic rotational signature in the torso.

3) Absence of Significant Translational or Rotational Spikes:
   – Walking or running would typically produce stronger, more periodic fluctuations in both acceleration and gyroscope data. Car travel might introduce more pronounced acceleration changes, especially if braking, turning, or accelerating/decelerating. Here, neither sensor set strongly indicates those.

The ranges on each axis (X: ~4.78–5.90, Y: ~7.07–7.87, Z: ~2.54–3.51) vary only modestly (on the order of ±1 m/s²), which is smaller than typical walking or running accelerations (where more pronounced repetitive spikes or bursts would appear).

2) Lack of clear periodic motion in the accelerometer: If the user were walking, one would usually expect a distinct cyclic pattern (footfalls) in the accelerometer signal. Here, the changes appear more like gentle shifts rather than a regular step cycle.

3) Low gyroscope magnitudes: The gyroscope signals remain quite small (generally within ±0.1–0.18), with only brief, minor excursions.

The small dips and peaks near the end (e.g., around 4.66 to 6.04 m/s² in the X‐axis) remain modest, suggesting minor shifts in orientation rather than sustained movement.

1) Magnitude and Variation of Accelerations:
   • The accelerometer readings do not remain near a single, nearly constant value (as would be expected in a Still scenario). Instead, they span ranges such as Ax≈4.2–6.9 m/s², Ay≈5.5–8.1 m/s², and Az≈1.9–6.1 m/s², showing regular fluctuations. These magnitudes and variations are larger than a quiet standing/sitting scenario.
   • For Running, accelerations often become higher in amplitude and more erratic. Although there are some surges (e.g., Ax up to ~6.9 m/s², Ay up to ~8.1 m/s², Az up to ~6.1 m/s²), they are not so large or frequent as one would typically see in running.
   • In a car, accelerations can become significant when turning or rapidly accelerating, but a torso-mounted phone in a car seat often shows longer periods of relatively steady readings broken by sudden spikes when the car brakes/accelerates/turns. Here, the accelerations exhibit a more continuous moderate fluctuation pattern suggestive of individual steps.

2) Gyroscope Characteristics:
   • The gyroscope signals stay within about ±0.3–0.4 rad/s, indicating moderate torso rotation. Running tends to produce higher or more frequent angular spikes on the torso, whereas very low or almost absent variations would fit Still or a smooth car ride. These moderate but not extreme rotations align with typical walking torso motion.

3) Magnetometer Drift:
   • The magnetometer axes show gradual changes (e.g., Mx rising from ~13 µT up to ~19–20+ µT). Such progressive shifts can arise simply from changing orientation (turning corners, changing heading) while walking. A car ride can also produce orientation changes, but often less continuous torso reorientation if the phone is held in place. The consistent drift here again lines up with walking movement.

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitudes: The accelerometer readings largely reflect gravity (≈9.81 m/s²) split across the X, Y, and Z axes, with only modest deviations. If the user were walking or running, we would expect more pronounced periodic fluctuations and higher dynamic accelerations. The ranges here (X and Y staying around 6–7 m/s², Z shifting from roughly 1 m/s² up to 4–5 m/s²) suggest posture/orientation changes rather than vigorous motion.

2) Lack of Strong Periodicity or High Peaks: Walking or running typically yields a clearer cyclical pattern in the accelerometer (due to steps) and, for running, larger amplitude peaks. These are absent in the provided data—there is no strong repeating pattern or large spikes beyond gravitational baseline.

3) Small Gyroscopic Rates: The gyroscope readings stay near zero with only small, brief spikes. Large or sustained angular rates (e.g., from more continuous turning of the torso or faster body motion) do not appear. This further supports that the user is not in active locomotion (walking, running, or in a moving car with turning forces).

4) Magnetometer Changes = Orientation Shifts: The magnetometer’s X-axis increases notably over time, and Y, Z remain negative but vary slightly. This is best explained by the phone slowly changing its heading/tilt (e.g., adjusting posture or position while standing) rather than continuous directional changes from driving.

Putting these observations together, the data aligns with a relatively stationary user who changes torso orientation moderately (leaning, twisting) but does not exhibit strong or repetitive accelerations typical of walking, running, or driving in a car. Therefore, the most likely label is “Still.”

1) Overall acceleration magnitude and variability:
   • The accelerometer readings remain in a very narrow range on all axes (X ~ 5.7–6.1, Y ~ 6.5–6.6, Z ~ 3.9–4.3). This implies little dynamic activity beyond the steady component of gravity shared across the X/Y/Z axes. If the user were walking, running, or in a moving vehicle, we would expect more pronounced fluctuations, peaks, or troughs.

2) Gyroscope signals:
   • Gyroscope values are basically at or very close to zero on all axes, with only small, random deviations. That confirms minimal rotation or turning of the smartphone.

3) Magnetometer readings:
   • Although the magnetometer has some variation, the changes are mild (13–16 in X, −25 to −23 in Y, around −38 to −36 in Z), indicating no large shifts in orientation or abrupt magnetic disturbances.

4) Comparison of sensor patterns to known activities:
   • Walking or running typically shows larger rhythmic or periodic spikes in the accelerometer and noticeable gyroscope activity. A car ride often shows certain bursts of acceleration or deceleration and some additional rotation if making turns. None of those patterns appear here.
   • The data instead shows consistently low amplitude changes in all IMU channels, matching a scenario where the user is basically not moving (still or standing). Hence ""Still"" is the best match.

1) Overall Accelerometer Behavior:
   • The accelerometer readings (X≈3–7, Y≈5–9+, Z≈1–7) show moderate-to-large variation, but not extremely high spikes that one might expect in vigorous running. The signal is clearly not near-constant (which would suggest Still).
   • The data exhibit fluctuations in all axes, suggesting a repeated or cyclical motion—like torso bobbing—rather than the short, abrupt bursts or mostly steady readings one might see in a car.

2) Gyroscope Magnitude:
   • The gyroscope signals are relatively small-to-moderate (|x| up to about 0.34, |y| up to about 0.70, etc.). Running typically produces higher angular rates on a phone attached to the torso, whereas sedentary or car-based movement could show either very low or isolated spikes. Here, the moderate bursts, especially around the Y-axis, align reasonably well with a walking gait—regular but not extreme rotational motions.

3) Magnetometer Changes:
   • The magnetometer readings reveal changing orientation (e.g., X drifting down from ~12–15 to nearly zero, Y and Z negative and shifting), indicating that the phone’s heading changes over the 10 s. This fits a scenario of mild turning or torso sway typical of walking.
   • In a car, one might see prolonged, smoother heading changes or corners, but less cyclical torso reorientation.

4) Excluding Other Activities:
   • Still: The accelerations and gyroscope signals are too varied, so it is not still.
   • Run: Running usually exhibits larger amplitude in accelerations and especially in cyclical angular velocities. These data seem more moderate.
   • Car: Driving tends to have steadier acceleration (except on turns or accelerations) and not regular up-down sway from steps.

Given these moderate, cyclic variations in accelerometer and modest gyroscope peaks, the most likely activity is Walking.",False

1) Overall Acceleration Magnitudes and Variability:
   • The accelerometer shows moderate oscillations on top of a steady offset (due to gravity). The X-axis ranges roughly 3.6–7.0 m/s², Y about 6.1–9.6 m/s², and Z about 1.2–4.2 m/s².  
   • These variations are neither negligible (as would be typical for a completely Still activity) nor very large (as often seen in Running, where peak values can easily exceed gravity by a wide margin).  
   • The fluctuations are too regular and moderate to be primarily from a car’s acceleration/braking, which would typically show more abrupt changes or prolonged steady segments.

2) Gyroscope Signals (Rotation):
   • The angular rates on all three axes remain clustered near zero (well under ±0.3 rad/s) with small spikes.  
   • This indicates low rotational speed. Although walking can introduce some device tilt back and forth, attaching the phone firmly at the torso often keeps gyroscope signals relatively small—consistent with the low-amplitude rotations seen here.

3) Magnetometer:
   • The magnetometer readings (mostly negative Y and Z, with X crossing negative to positive) indicate slow changes in orientation with respect to Earth’s field.  
   • This further aligns with small but persistent movement, as would occur when walking around, rather than remaining still or undergoing rapid orientation changes (e.g., vigorous running or large car turns).

4) Conclusion:
   • The moderate fluctuations in the accelerometer, low gyroscope variability, and slow magnetometer drifts point most strongly to a Walking pattern.

   • The mean acceleration across x, y, z-axes is roughly in the 9–9.8 m/s² range (once you combine them vectorially), consistent with the phone’s orientation capturing gravity. However, there are notable excursions (e.g., x-axis spikes up to ~7.7 from a ~5–5.5 baseline, y up to ~8.5, z up to ~5.4). These variations exceed what we would expect if the user were simply standing still.
   • Compared to running, the variations here are moderate rather than extremely large (running often induces higher‐amplitude oscillations and stronger, more rapid changes). The data do not show very large peaks (e.g., well above 10 m/s²) or a high‐frequency pattern that would be typical of running.

2) Gyroscope Amplitudes:
   • The gyroscope readings stay mostly within ±0.2–0.3 rad/s bursts, with no sustained high angular velocity. Running often generates larger and more rapid rotational swings, while being completely still would show almost no variation. These moderate ranges suggest movement, but not an intense, continuous rotational motion.

3) Still vs. Walking vs. Driving (Car):
   • Still: We would expect accelerations to remain fairly constant near gravity, with only very small fluctuations. Here, there are regular dips and spikes that are more than minor shifts.
   • Car (driving): We might see relatively smooth accelerations with occasional jolts from braking, turning, or accelerating. However, the repeated moderate fluctuations in all three accelerometer axes (particularly the up–down and forward–back components) are more characteristic of natural gait cycles than of driving.
   • Walking: The amplitude and frequency of these moderate fluctuations are quite typical of torso motion during walking—noticeable but not as large or high‐frequency as running.

This suggests that the phone (and hence the torso) is not undergoing strong or continuous accelerations that would be expected during running or brisk walking.
2. Gyroscope Rotations: The gyroscope signals remain quite low, well under ±0.3 (rad/s or deg/s scale). Larger, more distinct rotational bursts would be expected if the user were running, making rapid turns, or experiencing sharper motions in a vehicle.

4. Magnetometer Consistency: The magnetometer readings are stable, with a negative Z (~−45 to −49) typical of a phone facing a relatively fixed orientation toward the Earth’s magnetic field. Minor variations on the X and Y axes match small orientation changes rather than large active movements.

2. The Y-axis in the accelerometer remains relatively stable at about 7–8+ m/s², suggesting the phone is upright and mostly capturing a gravitational component rather than strong dynamic movement.

3. The gyroscope readings remain close to zero (within ±0.1–0.2 rad/s) across all axes, indicating little sustained rotation. There are only small spikes, which could be occasional torso twists or shifts rather than continuous motion.

4. The magnetometer data does show orientation changes (particularly in the X and Y components), but these changes are best explained by mild turns or posture adjustments rather than the pronounced or repetitive heading changes one might see with actual locomotion or driving.

5. Putting this together, the IMU signals reflect a relatively still posture with minor posture shifts or slight turning—not enough sustained or periodic movement to classify as walking, running, or driving.

1) Overall Motion Level: The accelerations are definitely not near-constant (which would suggest “Still”). We see ranges on each axis of several m/s², including some peaks (e.g., x up to ~6.3, z up to ~8). That already rules out “Still.”

2) Character of the Acceleration Spikes: The acceleration varies in a moderate band (roughly 3–8 m/s² across axes), with occasional bursts around 5–6 m/s² on x and larger swings on z. While these bursts show clear body-induced movement, they are not so large as one might typically see with running, which would more consistently produce higher-amplitude peaks (often well above 10 m/s² total) and a faster, more repetitive rhythm.

3) Gyroscope Readings: The gyro signals remain relatively low (near zero most of the time with a few spikes around 0.2–0.3 rad/s). This suggests that, while there is some torso rotation, it is not extreme or sustained—again consistent with normal walking rather than vigorous running, where torso rotation (and hence gyroscope activity) can become more prominent.

4) Distinction from Riding in a Car: In car travel, the acceleration patterns often show more random or smoother changes (related to turning, braking, road bumps) and less of the regular “impact-frequency” seen with footfalls. Here, the moderate cyclical bursts in the acceleration signal are more characteristic of footstep-induced oscillations than of typical vehicle dynamics.

5) Conclusion: Because the motion is clearly non-stationary but not high-amplitude or high-frequency enough to suggest running, and because the pattern is more step-like than the random road/turning effects of a car, the best match is “Walking.”"
